A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright and trademark protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.
BACKGROUND OF PRIOR ART
Continuous swimming tanks are known generally. German Patent No. 2,222,594 issued to Hoppe shows a continuous swimming tank. In the tank described therein, water circulates from the front of a swimming area past the swimmer to the rear of the swimming area where it is recalculated through a duct which runs beneath the floor of the swimming area. One set of turning vanes directs the water from the swimming area to the recirculation duct. The water passes over a propeller located in the duct and used for circulation. The second set of turning vanes directs the water from the recirculation duct back into the front of the swimming area.
The swimming area shown in the German '594 patent widens from the front of the tank to the rear of the tank. That is, the cross-sectional area of the swimming area increases from the front to the rear of the tank. This results in velocity variations over the length of the tank. The velocity of the flowing water is greater at the front of the swimming area than it is at the rear of the swimming area. Thus, a swimmer may choose where to swim, according to water velocity. The flow rate of water is constant anywhere in a given cross-section, perpendicular to the direction of water flow. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
The problem with such a design is that it requires a large swimming area and thus a large swimming tank. Further, a large motor and great deal of power is required to circulate such a large volume of water.
U.S. Pat. No. 2,035,835 issued to Raber for โSwimming Bathโ shows a continuous swimming tank. In this reference, water is circulated either beneath the floor of the swimming area or around the sides of the swimming area. No turning vanes are used to direct the water. The problem with such a tank is that large amounts of turbulence are developed, and loss of water velocity results. Therefore, more power is needed to circulate the water, and swimming comfort is adversely affected by the turbulence. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,021 issued to James Murdock for a โContinuous swimming apparatusโ discloses and claims swim treadmill which is said to avoid the power and size shortcomings of the prior art by providing a compact swimming apparatus. The apparatus consists essentially of a tank adapted to contain water and having a swimming area within the tank. Water flows through the swimming area from a water entrance end to a water exit end and returns to the water entrance end via a return path. Water circulation means is included in the return path for propelling the water through the return path and through the swimming area. A plurality of vanes is located in the return path to direct the water from the return path to the entrance end of the swimming area and from the exit end of the swimming area to the return path. The vanes help to minimize power losses by minimizing water turbulence. The vanes are spaced in such a way as to create a horizontal velocity gradient across the swimming area whereby water closer to the center of the swimming area has a higher velocity than water near the sides of the swimming area. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
Additional prior art of interest include U.S. Pat. No. 1,731,554 issued to M. I. Wheeler for โSwimming Poolโ and U.S. Pat. No. 722,232 issued to Hoeglauer for โBathtubโ. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a simplified perspective view of the major components comprising the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein. As shown, the pool is comprised of an externally positioned power system used to drive a hydraulic system which is connected by hydraulic hoses to and drives a water propulsion system. See FIG. 1. The quality of the water used is maintained by the water quality system which continually processes a slipstream of the water contained within the self-contained swimming pool. See FIG. 1.
The propulsion system is mounted at a first end of the self-contained swimming pool for containment of water and generation of water current flows. The water current flows delivered from the first end to the second end of the pool for exercise, therapy and or rehabilitation of a user. During operation, the user typically faces the propulsion unit. The self-contained exercise pool is sized so that during operation a user may swim or exercise against the current generated by the propulsion system. The inner water containment area is created by a rigid frame around the outer perimeter therein. A set of water return channels within intake ports at the second end of the pool allow the return of the water current flows back to the propulsion system. To maximize user functionality, a seating surface has been placed upon the water return channels to allow for user seating on either side of the water current flows.
As illustrated in FIGS. 1, 4 and 7, the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein may be adapted for various types and sizes of top decorative surfaces including an eight (8โณ) inch walk-way as shown at FIGS. 2-4 and a two foot (2โฒ) walkway as shown at FIGS. 7-9. As required by local regulations, the self-contained exercise pool as described herein may be adapted for grounding through installation of grounding straps along the bottom portion of the tension straps.
FIGS. 4-6 illustrate the steel supports of the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein. FIG. 10 illustrates the tension straps of the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein. The combination of the modular steel supports shown at FIG. 4 or FIG. 9 and the tension straps of FIG. 10 produce an interlocking frame structure of sufficient rigidity during operation that tile may be used as the top decorative surface. (See FIG. 11) The choice of tile for the top decorative surface improves the overall aesthetic of the self-contained exercise pool increasing user desirability.
The hydraulic pumping system is exteriorly mounted and also self-contained. The hydraulic pumping system has an electrically driven pump to circulate the glycol based pumping solution through hydraulic hoses connected to the propulsion system. The glycol solution chosen is non-toxic to humans and animals. Although the system as designed to minimize the potential for glycol to enter the water of the pool, however, if the glycol material does enter the water within the inner containment area, it is easily separated from the water through the filtration system of the pool. See FIG. 1. Because electrical pumping systems as well as hydraulic systems are well known in the art, further discussion is unnecessary as related to the present art.
It is well known in the prior art to use vegetable oil as the hydraulic fluid to drive the propulsion system. The problem with using vegetable oil as the hydraulic fluid is that if it introduced into the pool at any time, such as through leakage or spillage, the vegetable oil is immiscible with the water forming a separate layer. The vegetable oil forms a coating or film upon the inner layer of the pool. Furthermore, the filtration system of the prior art is not equipped to remove the vegetable oil from the water. Typically, the operator must remove the contents of the pool and thoroughly wash the unit which requires almost complete disassembly of the pool unit and its component parts so they may be washed down with soap and water prior to re-assembly.
The glycol based pumping solution of the present embodiment is designed for low maintenance and long use. Typically, viscosity breakdown of the glycol solution is of major concern to the prior art. The present system addresses this problem by maintaining a relatively constant temperature of the pumping solution by using a heat exchanger positioned in the inner water circulation area to allow transfer of any excess heat built up in the pumping solution to be transferred to the circulated water. (Not shown) This innovation solves the viscosity breakdown problem. The glycol solution, should it be mixed into the water, through leakage or spillage, is easily removed the existing filtration system. Minor hydraulic fluid leaks of the glycol water solution are hardly noticed by the user. Major glycol leaks into the water of the pool typically present a cloudy appearance which is easily corrected by draining the pool, fixing the leak and refilling the pool with water. No disassembly of the pool or its major components is necessary.
It is therefore an objective of the present invention to create a self-enclosed swimming pool for use as a water treadmill for use in exercise or rehabilitation.
It is another objective of the present invention for the self-enclosed swimming pool to be self-supporting.
It is another objective of the present invention for the rigid frame of the self-enclosed swimming pool to be modular in design to allow for improved delivery and assembling.
It is also an objective of the present invention for the self-enclosed swimming pool to drive the propulsion system with a hydraulic system with a solution which is non-toxic to both humans and pets.
