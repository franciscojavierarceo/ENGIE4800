The coil (3) can consist of a plurality of coil layers (9, 17) separated by insulating layers (11).

The individual turns of the coil (3) can be disposed and dimensioned so as to permit embossing of the circuit unit without restriction within an area (37, 38) conforming with the standard.|"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to a circuit unit comprising at least an insulating substrate on which a conductive coil is located, and an integrated circuit whose connection points are electrically connected with the coil ends. The invention relates further to a method for producing such a circuit unit.
2. Related Technology
Circuit units of the above type are known from the prior art, being designed for example as compact electronic modules which are inserted in chip cards for noncontacting data exchange with a terminal. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4,999,742 discloses a circuit unit in the form of an electronic module with an insulating substrate on which a ring-shaped wound coil is glued. The coil ends are guided into the receiving space arising through the ring-shaped coil, and electrically connected there with the connection points of an integrated circuit. The receiving space for the integrated circuit and coil ends is cast with a casting compound for protecting these sensitive components from mechanical loads.
The electronic module known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,999,742 has a compact structure but the coil must be wound in a separate method step and glued on the insulating substrate in a further method step.
However, the as yet unpublished German patent application P 44 16 697.4 discloses a circuit unit in the form of a chip card having printed on one card layer of the multilayer card body a coil from a conductive lacquer whose ends are electrically connected with the connection points of an integrated circuit.
The structure of the circuit unit known from patent application 44 16 697.4 has the advantage that the coil is printed directly on a card layer so that the method step of applying a separately manufactured coil to an insulating substrate is omitted. For some applications of the circuit unit, however, it is desirable for the coil to have a higher number of turns than can be realized with the structure explained above. Furthermore it may be desirable to provide the circuit unit with relief embossing. One must then make sure the printed turns of the coil, which are generally formed as a very thin layer, are not interrupted. Also, the production method for the circuit unit should be further optimized with regard to inexpensive mass production.
From U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,893 (Inoue) a circuit unit in the form of an IC card is known. The IC card comprises an electronic module with a coil structure being formed on the semiconductor substrate of the electronic module. A coil may be formed of two or more coil structures which are deposited on different metallic layers having insulation layers between the metallic layers whereat the metallic layers are interconnected by means of a central conductive member which extends between the distinct metallic layers.
However, the Inoue patent teaches forming the coil on the substrate of the IC chip. As the production of semiconductor devices is very expensive and the yield depends directly on the area of semiconductor covered by the IC chip, the teaching of Inoue has both the disadvantage of high cost and low yield as the area covered by the an IC comprising coil structure is enormous. The size of the IC chip has the further disadvantage of being susceptible to mechanical stress. The IC chip is embedded in the card body which is flexible therefore torsion or bend may destroy the IC card or the IC chip.
From JP 6 336096 a chip card is known which is produced from two insulating substrates. Each of the substrates has a coil pattern. After connecting the two substrates by an insulating adhesive the two coil patterns form one coil.
However, as it is stated expressly not to use a through hole for contacting the two coil patterns and as the coil patterns are formed on different substrates, chip cards having coil layers and insulating layers which are applied alternately to a substrate are discouraged.
From EP 0 547 563 B1 a printed circuit board antenna is known which has a plurality of different coil layers. However the European patent does not show the use of an IC chip. In particular this is a disadvantage because the two coil ends are on different sides of the circuit board. If an IC chip is to be mounted on one side of the circuit board an additional through hole is necessary to connect the IC to the second end of the coil. Additional connectors are also necessary to connect the different layers of the coil which is especially a disadvantage because an additional step is necessary to insert the connectors.
It is therefore the problem of the invention to further improve the abovementioned circuit unit and at the same time in particular to extend its range of applications. It is further the problem of the invention to propose a method for producing such a circuit unit.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
One advantage of the invention is to be seen in that a higher number of turns can be realized than on the structure known from German patent application 44 16 697.4. The coil can still be applied directly to the substrate of the circuit unit so that an additional method step for applying a separately manufactured coil is unnecessary. This is made possible by the fact that coil layers and insulating layers are applied alternately to the insulating substrate, the individual coil layers being electrically interconnected via plated-through holes so as to yield a coil. The coil layers and insulating layers are preferably printed on. Alternatively it is also possible for the insulating layers to consist of thin insulating foils on which the coil layers are printed on one or both sides. The throughplating through the insulating layers can be done in the simplest case by providing windows or holes in the insulating layers through which the conductive material of the coil layers penetrates when the coil layers are printed on or the layers laminated together. Additional conductive material can likewise be applied for throughplating, or additional conductive elements provided.
A further advantage of the invention is to be seen in that the circuit unit can be manufactured especially easily by the multiple-copy method, since one can apply the coil layers and also the insulating layers (depending on the embodiment) using printing technology, with which multiple-copy production is commonplace.
Furthermore the invention has the advantage that the coil ends can be adapted especially easily to the various possibilities of forming the electric connection between the coil ends and the connection points of the integrated circuit.
Furthermore it is advantageous that the invention permits relief embossing of the circuit unit without restriction, with no danger of one or more turns of the coil being interrupted. For this purpose the turns of the coil are guided outside the relief embossing area of the circuit unit or between the individual relief embossing lines, whereby the width of the turns can be greater than the line spacing for compensating production tolerances, or the turns run in the area of the embossed characters but are wider than the character size.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
FIG. 1 shows systematically a circuit unit in the form of a chip card for noncontacting data exchange in a plan view. The dimensions of such chip cards are identical with the dimensions of chip cards for contacting data exchange, which are fixed in ISO standard 7810. The circuit unit contains insulating substrate 1 in the form of a card layer on which coil 3 is located whose free ends 15 and 19 are electrically connected with the connection points of integrated circuit 7. The integrated circuit can also be cast into a module which, for easier contacting of integrated circuit 7, has contact surfaces which are electrically connected with the connection points of integrated circuit 7. The turns of coil 3 run along the outer edge of the card layer, yielding a large-area coil in the interests of high energy input.
FIG. 2 shows a perspective view not true to scale of an inventive circuit unit which is produced as described in the following. On insulating substrate 1, which exists e.g. in the form of a card layer (see FIG. 1) one first applies first coil layer section 9, which is dash-lined in FIG. 2 and can contain a plurality of turns (coil layer section 9 shown contains only one turn in order not to complicate the drawing). Coil layer section 9 is preferably printed on with a conductive lacquer, but it is also possible to spray on the coil layer using a corresponding mask, or to etch it out of a conductive coating located on the substrate. Other production techniques are conceivable.
After applying coil layer section 9 one applies to insulating substrate 1 insulating layer 11, which is hatched in FIG. 2 and covers the turns of coil layer section 9. Insulating layer 11 has window 13 and is applied to coil layer section 9 in such a way that first end 15 of coil layer section 9 is not covered thereby and at least the second end area of the last turn of coil layer section 9 is accessible through window 13. Insulating layer 11 is preferably likewise printed on, but it is also possible here to spray it on using a corresponding mask or to use as insulating layer 11 a thin insulating foil, etc.
In a further method step one applies further coil layer section 17 to insulating layer 11 using the same techniques as for applying coil layer section 9. Further coil layer section 17 is preferably also printed on. Coil layer section 17 is electrically connected with coil layer 9 through window 13 in insulating layer 11, yielding coil 3 consisting of coil layer sections 9 and 17. One can facilitate the formation of an electric connection between coil layer section 9 and 17 by making the coil ends which are electrically interconnected wider than the turns of the coil, as also shown in FIG. 2. It is easy to realize such widening by printing technology. Details on the connecting technique will be described below.
One can optionally repeat the application of further insulating layers and coil layer sections in the explained manner once or several times until circuit unit coil 3 composed of the coil layer sections has the desired number of turns. One must thereby make sure that first end 15 of the coil layer section first printed on (e.g. layer 9) is not covered, and that the circuit unit does not exceed a predetermined height. When printing on the last coil layer section (e.g. layer 17) one can overprint first end 15 of the first printed coil layer section with a conductive lacquer again. One then obtains two freshly printed first coil ends 15 and 19 of the coil layer sections which can be electrically connected with the integrated circuit especially easily. First end 19 of the last applied coil layer section, i.e. coil layer section 17 in FIG. 2, is applied in such a way that it is especially easy to form an electric connection first from coil ends 15 and 19 to integrated circuit 7. In the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 2 the coil layer sections and insulating layers are applied to insulating substrate 1 in a kind of frame. In the shown embodiment, coil section ends 15 and 19 are guided into the interior of the frame onto insulating substrate 1. One avoids superimposition of turns in a coil layer section by guiding the internal first ends of the particular coil layers into the part enclosed by the frame, as shown in FIG. 2.
By suitable choice of the coil ends which are electrically connected with the integrated circuit one can always avoid superimposition of turns in a coil layer section. For example, if coil end 19 is to be outside the frame the internal or second end of coil layer section 17 is connected with second end of coil layer section 9 (FIG. 3) and the external first end of coil layer 17 guided outward.
Alternatively it is also possible to apply an insulating layer section with a window to the last coil layer, whose free first end is connected with the integrated circuit. Through the window the free coil end can then be guided over the coil layer section in any direction, since no short-circuit can occur between the turns of the coil because of the covering insulating layer.
According to the embodiment of FIG. 2 one applies integrated circuit 7 to the noncovered part of insulating substrate 1, electrically connecting the connection points of the circuit with first ends 15 and 19 of the resulting coil formed by electrically connected sections 9 and 17 e.g. by means of bonding wires 21. One can simplify the formation of the electric connections from integrated circuit 7 to coil ends 15 and 19 by making the coil ends wider than the individual turns of the coil. For this purpose one need only accordingly adapt the artwork or, if the coil layers sprayed on, the masks used. No separate method steps are thus necessary for producing widened coil ends.
FIG. 3 shows a cross section along line III—III of FIG. 2 to illustrate the sequence of layers. Coil layer section 9 is applied to insulating substrate 1, being covered by insulating layer 11 containing window 13 through which further coil layer section 17 is electrically connected with coil layer section 9. Layer 17 is located farther from the substrate 1 then layer 9. Second ends 15a and 19a of layers 9 and 17 overlap at the window 13 in insulation layer 11. A portion 11a of layer 11 overlaps second end 15a of layer 9. Further insulating layers and coil layers can follow alternately.
In a variant the connection between integrated circuit 7 and coil ends 15 and 19 is not formed via bonding wires but by directly mounting integrated circuit 7 on coil ends 15 and 19. For this purpose integrated circuit 7, or module 23 containing integrated circuit 7, can either be mounted on coil ends 15 and 19 already applied, or circuit 7 or module 23 is first inserted in substrate 1 and then overprinted with coil ends 15 and 19.
FIGS. 4A and 4B show cross sections of two embodiments of the inventive circuit unit wherein coil first ends 15 and 19 were first printed on substrate 1, and module 23 or integrated circuit 7 then mounted on coil ends 15 and 19. Module 23 or integrated circuit 7 can be mounted either directly after the printing operation or only after a short period of time in which the printed conductive lacquer dries at least partly.
FIG. 4a shows substrate 1 with printed coil ends 15 and 19 and module 23. Module 23 contains integrated circuit 7 which is coated by casting compound 8 and whose connection points 27 are electrically connected with contacts 25 of module 23 via bonding wires. Module 23 is mounted on coil ends 15 and 19 in such a way that contacts 25 of module 23 touch coil ends 15, 19. The arrangement shown in FIG. 4a can be covered by a cover foil not shown in the figures, which optionally contains a gap for module 23. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4a, module 23 is mounted on coil ends 15 and 19 in such a way that casting compound 8 points away from coil ends 15 and 19. However it is also possible to mount the module turned by 180°. In this case one should provide a corresponding gap in substrate 1 for partly receiving casting compound 8. This variant is used in particular when a low overall height of the circuit unit is to be achieved.
FIG. 4b again shows substrate 1 with printed coil ends 15 and 19. Integrated circuit 7 is mounted on coil ends 15 and 19 in such a way that connection points 27 of integrated circuit 7 touch coil ends 15, 19. As in the embodiment of FIG. 4a, the structure shown in FIG. 4b can also be protected by a cover foil not shown, which can optionally contain a gap for integrated circuit 7.
FIGS. 5A and 5B show cross sections of two embodiments of the inventive circuit unit whereby module 23 or integrated circuit 7 is overprinted for contacting with coil ends 15 and 19.
In FIG. 5a module 23 is fit into substrate 1 in such a way that the surface of module 23 is flush with the surface of substrate 1. Coil ends 15 and 19 printed on after insertion of module 23 in substrate 1 extend over the surface of module 23 so far that they partly cover contacts 25 of module 23 so as to form an electric connection between contacts 25 and coil ends 15 and 19.
In FIG. 5b integrated circuit 7, instead of module 23, is inserted into substrate 1 in such a way that the surface of integrated circuit 7 is flush with the surface of substrate 1 and connection points 27 of integrated circuit 7 point upward. Coil ends 15 and 19 are printed on substrate 1 in such a way that they extend over connection points 27 of integrated circuit 7. This forms an electric connection between connection points 27 and each coil end 15 and 19. For embedding integrated circuit 7 in substrate 1 one can either provide a corresponding gap, or press the chip into substrate 1 using heat and pressure.
Some variants for throughplating will now be described with which one can form electric connections between two coil layers or between a coil layer and connection point 27 of integrated circuit 7 or contact 25 of module 23 through insulating layer 11, for example a thin insulating foil.
FIG. 6 shows an embodiment of the inventive circuit unit in cross section, in which the throughplating takes place when the individual layers of the circuit unit are laminated together. One can see the sequence of layers of the circuit unit before the laminating process.
According to FIG. 6 substrate 1a with coil layer section 17 and substrate 1b with coil layer section 9 are separated from each other by insulating foil 11. Window 13 is provided in foil 11 by punching, piercing or by laser beam at a place where coil layer section 9 and 17 are opposite each other. Lamination produces a composite from individual layers 1a, 1b and 11. Simultaneously the laminating process forms an electric connection between coil layer section 9 and coil layer section 17 through window 13. This can be supported by applying to at least one of coil layer section 9 and 17 opposite window 13 a small portion of conductive adhesive 29 which flows into window 13 during lamination, thereby forming an electric connection between coil layer section 9 and 17.
FIG. 7 shows an embodiment of the inventive circuit unit in cross section, in which insulating foil 11 is printed with coil layer section 9, 17 one on each side, with layer section 9 and 17 partly overlapping. In the overlap area insulating foil 11 has one or more windows 13 which are produced for example by punching, piercing or by laser beam. When coil sections 9 and 17 are printed on insulating foil 11 by the screen printing method, windows 13 are filled with the printing material, for example a conductive lacquer, thereby forming electric connections between ends or coil sections 9 and 17.
FIG. 8 shows a further embodiment for throughplating. As in FIG. 7 ends of coil sections 9 and 17 are applied to the opposite sides of insulating foil 11 so that they partly overlap. In the overlap area at least one thin wire 31 is slipped in to penetrate the end of coil layer section 17, insulating foil 11 and at least partly also the end of coil layer section 9, thereby forming an electric connection between coil sections 9 and 17. Wire 31 can also be fed completely through coil layer section 9 and bent at its end by a suitable apparatus. To facilitate the feedthrough of wire 31 one can heat it in one variant of the embodiment.
FIG. 9 shows an embodiment in which coil layer sections 9 and 17 are first applied to the opposite sides of insulating foil 11. At least one window 13 is then provided in coil layer sections 9 and 17 and intermediate insulating foil 11, for example by punching, piercing or by laser beam, in the area where opposite ends of coil layer sections 9 and 17 overlap. Window 13 is finally filled with conductive adhesive 33 and an electric connection thus formed between coil layer sections 9 and 17.
FIGS. 10A and 10B shows an embodiment in which an electric connection can be formed between ends of coil layer sections 9 and 17 by means of connecting element 35.
FIG. 10a shows the sequence of layers of the circuit unit before the laminating process. Coil layer section 9 is applied to substrate 1. Above substrate 1 there is insulating foil 11 which carries coil layer section 17 and has window 13 in an area opposite coil layer section 9 and adjacent coil layer section 17. Connecting element 35 is disposed on auxiliary carrier foil 37 above window 13 and overlapping with coil layer section 17. Connecting element 35 can consist for example of a thermally activable conductive adhesive.
FIG. 10b shows the layer structure from FIG. 10a after lamination. The layers shown in FIG. 10a can be joined into a compound under pressure and heat by means of a conventional laminating press. The laminating press die pressing against the top of the structure is formed so that connecting element 35 is pressed through window 13 against coil layer section 9 and connects therewith during the laminating process. The other end of connecting element 35 is pressed against coil layer section 17 and connects therewith. This forms an electric connection between coil layers section 9 and 17. Auxiliary carrier foil 37 comes off connecting element 35 during lamination and is then removed.
In a variant of the invention one can omit window or windows 13 in insulating layer 11. In this variant there is no electric connection between the individual coil layer sections. The coil sections are instead coupled capacitively. Capacitive coupling can also be used for coupling integrated circuit 7 with coil 3 so that an electric connection can likewise be omitted here.
A further aspect of the invention is that it eliminates restrictions that existed up to now with respect to relief-embossing a circuit unit containing coil 3. This can be done by various measures each applicable with both single-layer and multilayer coils 3.
FIG. 11 shows a circuit unit in a plan view, with dotted lines delimiting areas 37 and 38 within which relief embossing is admissible in chip cards according to ISO standard 7811. Relief embossing can be used for example to bring out letters and numbers or other characters. The embossed characters can be printed on a paper voucher with a suitable apparatus if required. However, embossing can damage coil 3. Lower area 37 is especially problematic in terms of possible damage to turns of the coil, since coil 3 is generally required to have a large area and the turns therefore run close to the edge of the circuit unit.
FIG. 12 shows an enlarged detail of the circuit unit shown in FIG. 11 in a plan view. To prevent interruption of the turns of coil 3, turn 39 is disposed between relief embossing field 37 and the edge of substrate 1 in the embodiment according to FIG. 3. If there is enough room, several turns or even all turns of coil 3 can also run here. Since no embossing occurs in this area there is no danger of the turns of coil 3 being interrupted by the embossing process. With a multilayer coil the room becomes scarce at higher numbers of turns than with a single-layer coil, since not all turns have to be disposed side by side.
Turns 41 running in the area of relief embossing field 37 are so greatly widened that they are wider than the size of the characters embossed there. This ensures that turns 41 are not interrupted by the embossing process, even if the embossed characters would each sever a cross section of turns 41 corresponding to the character size. If there is not enough room for one or more turns 39 outside relief embossing field 37, all turns 41 can be guided through relief embossing field 37.
FIG. 13 likewise shows an enlarged detail of the circuit unit shown in FIG. 11 in a plan view. According to the embodiment shown in FIG. 13 the turns of coil 3 are guided either between relief embossing field 37 and the edge of the circuit unit (turn 39), or following the relief embossing lines or between the individual relief embossing lines (turns 43). Turns 43 running between the relief embossing lines or directly following the relief embossing lines are somewhat widened to compensate production tolerances. This ensures that at least a partial area of turns 43 runs on a surface which is not embossed so that there is no danger of turns 43 being interrupted. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 13 it also depends on the exact dimension of the turns whether no turn at all, or at least one turn 39, can be guided past the relief embossing field, i.e. whether there is enough room for one or even for several turns 39 between relief embossing field 37 and the edge of the substrate. The turn variants shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 can also be combined.
Besides the already outlined measures, others are also conceivable for preventing interruption of the turns of coil 3 by embossing. For example the properties of the coating material used for producing the turns can be adapted as greatly as possible to substrate 1 to which they are applied, so that the coating material does not crack and thus interrupt the turns during embossing. It is likewise conceivable to use as a coating material conductive plastics which are so elastic that they do not crack during embossing.
In the embodiments in which one or more turns 39 are guided between relief embossing field 37 and the edge of the circuit unit, the resistance of coil 3 might possibly assume inadmissibly high values since turns 39 must be very narrow due to the little room available. This problem can be counteracted by applying turns 39 in greater layer thicknesses, which can be done for example by multiple printing. It is likewise possible to reduce the resistance by widening turns 39 in the areas where enough room is available.
The circuit unit can be produced either in single piece production or via sheets or webs which are divided into individual circuit units at the end of production.
The described measures for improving the circuit unit, for example providing a multilayer coil structure whereby different throughplating variants are possible, permitting relief embossing of the circuit unit by suitably selecting the coil layer dimensions and pattern, optionally also material, and directly contacting the integrated circuit or module with the coil, can be used either singly or in combination."

The tilt hinge is composed of: a holder attached to either of the first member or the second member; a shaft which is attached to either the other one of the first member and the second member while also attached to the holder so as to be rotatable with respect thereto and to be non-movable in an axial direction; a plurality of first friction disks inserting the shaft rotatably and movably in the axial direction through an insertion hole of each disk and held by the holder; a plurality of second friction disks inserting similarly the shaft through an insertion hole of each disk, being interposed between the first friction disks, restrained its rotation by the shaft and movably in the axial direction; and an elastic means attached to the shaft to cause the first friction disks and the second friction disks to press-contact each other in the axial direction.|"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a tilt hinge suitable for use in small-sized office automation equipment such as a laptop-type computer and a notebook-type computer, for connecting a keyboard base, a first member and a display device, a second member, so as to allow to pivot frictionally.
2. Description of the Related Art
A laptop-type computer or a notebook-type computer is composed of a keyboard base and a display device which is openably and closably attached to the keyboard base through tilt hinges. Such a computer is usually folded into two, but when in use, it is structured such that the display device is opened to the keyboard base. Since such types of computers are required to be as thin and compact as possible, tilt hinges are also required to have a small diameter and a high friction function. The following disclosure is well known as the one satisfying such a requirement.
Translated National Publication of Patent Application No. 2000-501149.
The friction hinge described in the above document has a structure that a plurality of washer-shaped clips each having a pair of arms are attached in piles in the axial direction to a holder non-rotatably, and through each pair of the arms a shaft is inserted press-contactedly, causing friction torque between the outer periphery of the shaft and the radial direction of each arm
Since such a friction hinge of a well-known structure described above is aimed at obtaining friction torque by sandwiching a shaft between a pair of arms of a washer-shaped clip, in order to obtain a required value in friction torque with a small-diameter hinge, there arises a disadvantage of requiring a large amount of clips due to smallness in friction area of each clip. Further, when obtaining friction torque of 100 kg-mm with a shaft having a diameter of approximately 7 mm, which is a development requirement of the present invention, a still larger amount of clips become necessary, causing the friction hinge to be longer in size in the axial direction.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The object of the present invention is to provide a small-sized, small-aperture tilt hinge which is capable of generating required friction torque.
To attain the above object, the present invention discloses a hinge connecting a first member and a second member which are opened and closed with respect to each other in a manner to be friction-rotatable. The hinge comprises: a holder attached to either one of the first member or the second member; a shaft attached to either the other one of the first member or the second member while also attached to the holder so as to be rotatable with respect thereto and to be non-movable in the axial direction; a plurality of first friction disks inserting the shaft rotatably and movably in the axial direction through an insertion hole of each disk and held by the holder; a plurality of second friction disks inserting the shaft through an insertion hole of each disk, being interposed between the first friction disks, restrained its rotation by the shaft and movably in the axial direction; and an elastic means attached to the shaft to cause the first friction disks and the second friction disks to press-contact each other in the axial direction.
In the present invention described above, either one of the first friction disk or the second friction disk may be formed of a hard material, while the other is formed of a soft material.
Further in the present invention, the first friction disks may have locking portions on the outer periphery thereof so that they are locked in the holder, while the second friction disks may have locking portions to be locked to the shaft in the insertion hole thereof through which the shaft is inserted.
In the present invention, the elastic means may be composed of a nut attached on an end portion of the shaft, and spring washers interposed between the nut and either one of the first friction disk or the second friction disk, while the shaft being inserted through the insertion hole of the spring washer.
Furthermore in the present invention, the elastic means may be composed of a nut attached on an end portion of the shaft, and a compression spring elastically provided between the nut and either one of the first friction disk or the second friction disk.
Moreover in the present invention, instead of the nut, a caulking portion formed by caulking the end portion of the shaft may be used as a nut.
Further in the present invention, the holder may include a case portion containing all or at least a part of the first friction disks and the second friction disks.
Furthermore in the present invention, in the first friction disk and/or the second friction disk, an oil reserving portion may be provided for lubricating the press-contact portion between them, and on an outside of a locking groove of the holder in which the locking portion of the first friction disk is locked, a depressed portion may be given to prevent a trembling of the first friction disk to the locking groove.

Hereinafter an embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings.
FIG. 1 shows a notebook-type personal computer using tilt hinges of the present invention, where Reference Numeral A denotes a first member which constitutes a keyboard base side, and Reference Numeral B represents a second member which constitutes a display device side. The first member A and the second member B are connected by the tilt hinges of the present invention at the positions shown as a pair of C portions such that they can be opened and closed with respect to each other.
FIGS. 2 to 6 show the tilt hinge of the present invention. In the drawings, Reference Numeral 1 denotes a holder attached to, for example, the keyboard base A side of the notebook-type personal computer, which constitutes the first member. The holder is composed of an attachment portion 1a and a case portion 1b. The case portion 1b has a sidewall 1d with a bearing hole 1c provided on one side thereof, and a cavity portion 1e holding therein first friction disks 2 and second friction disks 3. The cavity portion 1e is provided with a locking groove 1f, which locks a locking portion 2c of the first friction disk 2. The attachment portion 1a is provided with attachment holes 1g and 1g. 
In the bearing hole 1c provided in the sidewall 1d of the holder 1, a shaft 4 is rotatably supported with its small-diameter portion 4a. In the shaft 4, further to the small-diameter portion 4a, a flange portion 4b forming a large-diameter portion and an attachment portion 4c having a semicircular cross-sectional face are provided. To the attachment portion 4c is attached the second member B shown by an imaginary line B in FIGS. 4 to 6. It is noted that the attachment portion 4c may be attached to the first member A, while the holder 1 may be attached to the second member B. In the shaft 4, the small-diameter portion 4a is trimmed of its both sides, thereby showing an approximately elliptical cross-sectional face, and an attachment hole 4d is provided in the attachment portion 4c. It is noted that each cross-sectional shape of the small-diameter portion 4a and the attachment portion 4c is not limited to those described in the embodiment of the present invention. Such shapes can be various, including a polygonal shape.
The first friction disk 2 is formed of a plate made from a hard and abrasion-resistant material such as SUS304CSP-1/2H, and composed of a friction generating portion 2b provided with a circular insertion hole 2a inserting the shaft 4, and the locking portion 2c protruding from the friction generation portion 2b. The first friction disk 2 comprises a plurality of plates each of which is housed in the cavity portion 1e of the holder 1, and fixed to the holder 1 by locking the locking portion 2c into a locking groove If in the cavity portion 1e, and a single sheet of the plate which is fixedly locked in a hollow portion 1h provided in the outside of the sidewall 1d of the holder 1. In the outer edge of the friction generating portion 3b, oil reserving portions 2d in a form of a plurality of notches are formed. It is noted that the position, quantity, and form for providing the oil reserving portion 2d in the first friction disk 2 are not limited to those described in the embodiment of the present invention. The oil reserving portion 2d may be provided along an inner periphery of the circular insertion hole 2a, or in the friction generating portion 2b by forming therein a small hole or a concave portion. It is also noted that as shown in FIGS. 4 to 6 particularly, on the outside of the case portion 1b of the holder 1, a depressed portion 1i is given to prevent a trembling of the locking portion 2c of the first friction disk 2, which is lockedly inserted in the locking groove 1f. 
The second friction disk 3 is also formed of a disk-shaped plate made from a hard and abrasion-resistant material such as SUS304CSP-1/2H. It includes the friction generating portion 3b provided with a deformed insertion hole 3a through which the shaft 4 is inserted, and an oil reserving portion 3c formed by a notch provided in the deformed insertion hole 3a. The second friction disks 3 comprise a plurality of disks where both sides or one side of each disk are/is in contact with the first friction disk 2 in the cavity portion 1e; a plurality of disks piled together to be used as a spacer; and the one disposed between the flange portion 4b of the shaft 4 on the outside of the holder portion 1 and the first friction disk 2. It is noted that those second friction disks 3 used as a spacer also may be an alternate arrangement of each of the first friction disks 2 and the second friction disks 3.
Reference Numeral 5 is an elastic means composed of a plurality of disk springs or spring washers 5a and 5a. The elastic means is elastically provided between the outmost one of the second friction disks 3 and the clamping nut 6 fitted in a male screw portion 4e provided in the small-diameter portion 4a, while inserting the small-diameter portion 4a of the shaft 4 into a circular-shaped insertion hole 5b provided along the axial direction of each center portion thereof.
Therefore, by clamping of the clamping nut 6, the first friction disk 2 and the second fiction disk 3 being adjacent to each other are strongly contactedly pressed. Here, rotation of the holder 1 or the shaft 4 causes respective friction generating portions 2b and 3b of the first friction disk 2 and the second friction disk 3 to contact each other on the surfaces thereof, whereby the friction area thereof increases and causes a strong friction torque onto the friction surface. The friction torque for the attachment portion 1a of the holder 1 and the attachment portion 4c of the shaft 4 both having an outer diameter of 7 mm, is approximately 100 kg-mm at maximum.
FIGS. 7 to 11 show another embodiment of a tilt hinge of the present invention, and the basic structure thereof is identical to the one for the embodiment referred earlier. The points of difference are: a first friction disk 10 is structured with a hard material which is prepared by heat-treatment of SK-5 for example, while a second friction disk 11 is structured with a soft material such as phosphor bronze C5210P-H; the shape of a first friction disk 10; an oil reserving portion 10a is provided along the inner periphery of an insertion hole 10b; a locking groove 12b is provided in the axial direction in an small-diameter portion 12a of a shaft 12, thereby a second friction disk 11 non-rotatably attached to the small-diameter portion 12a of the shaft 12 allows a locking piece 11b to protrude toward a portion of the insertion hole 11a so that the locking piece 11b fits into the locking groove 12b; none of the second friction disks 11 is used as a spacer; disk springs 13 are not faced toward the same direction as in the aforementioned embodiments, but elastically arranged with one half set thereof confronting the other half set. The rest of the constituents are identical to the corresponding ones in the embodiment described earlier, thus the explanation thereof will be omitted here. Incidentally, Reference Numeral 11c denotes an oil reserving portion of the second friction disk 11.
FIG. 12 shows still another embodiment of a tilt hinge of the present invention. According to the drawing, it differs from each of the embodiments described earlier on the point that a compression spring 15 is used as an elastic means instead of a disk spring or a spring washer.
With this embodiment, the object of the present invention can also be attained. The constituents without reference numerals are identical to those in the embodiments described earlier, and will not be explained here.
FIG. 13 shows yet another embodiment of a tilt hinge of the present invention, where a retaining washer 16 and a caulking portion 17b of a small-diameter portion 17a of a shaft 17 are used instead of the clamping nut in the embodiments described earlier.
With this embodiment, the object of the present invention can also be attained, and its simpler structure allows lowering of the manufacturing cost.
It should be noted that in the above embodiments, for the first friction disk and the second friction disk, structure, shape, and way of combination, as well as whether to use a hard material only or to arrange hard and soft materials alternately are not limited, except that both the first friction disks and the second friction disks should be piled in at least two pieces. Further in the above embodiments, basically used is lubricating oil, but it can be omitted by fluorine coating or nitriding of respective washer surfaces."

The cut-outs are generally symmetric with each other and form a pair of hooks on each side of said detent portion. The cut-out on one side of the detent portion of each of said rails is for receiving a claw of the windshield wiper assembly and the hooks on the opposite side of the detent portion of each of the rails are for engaging a windshield wiper blade of the windshield wiper assembly.|"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly. In particular, the present invention is directed to a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly which stiffens the windshield wiper blade while allowing the windshield wiper blade to flex to conform to the curvature of a windshield of a vehicle. The present invention is also directed to a rail for a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly and a method of manufacturing a rail for a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly.
2. Description of Related Art
Various types of backing strips for windshield wiper assemblies are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,185,805 is directed to a method of forming a windshield wiper. The windshield wiper includes a wiping blade having two recesses for receiving a pair of backing strips. The backing strips include two teeth for retaining the backing strip and two stops which receive a claw of the windshield wiper. However, the stops which are formed on one side of each of the backing strips must be used such that they face outwardly to receive the claw of the windshield wiper. In view of this, it is not possible to use the backing strips such that either side of the backing strips can receive the claw of the windshield wiper.
In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,730 is directed to a wiper blade with a reinforcing rail locating means. The rails include recesses on opposite sides thereof that are located at opposite ends of the rail. This provides reversibility of the rails. However, the recesses in the rails are not for receiving a claw of a windshield wiper assembly, but are for receiving an increased thickness portion of the wiper blade. In view of this, the rails can only be used with a non-extruded wiper blade.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly, which eliminates the above problems encountered with conventional windshield wiper frame connectors.
It is another object of the present invention to provide a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly which includes rails having a detent portion on only one end. This allows the manufacture of a single rail, which can be used on either side of a windshield wiper blade to secure the windshield wiper blade to a windshield wiper assembly.
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly which can be used with an extruded windshield wiper blade and prevent the windshield wiper blade from sliding with respect to the remaining portions of the windshield wiper assembly.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly, which includes rails having a detent portion with a pair of symmetric cut-outs which form a central portion therebetween. The central portion is preferably formed to have a width, which is wider than a body of the rail to increase the amount of force applied by the claw of the windshield wiper assembly.
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly, which is inexpensive and easy to manufacture. In addition, it is an object of the present invention to provide a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly which requires only one type of rail that can be used on either side of a windshield wiper blade.
The above objects are accomplished by a backing strip for windshield wiper assembly, comprising a pair of rails, each of said pair of rails including a body portion and a detent portion, said detent portion including a cut-out on each side thereof, said cut-outs being generally symmetric with each other and forming a pair of hooks on each side of said detent portion, wherein the cut-out on one side of said detent portion of each of said rails is for receiving a claw of the windshield wiper assembly and the hooks on the opposite side of the detent portion of each of the rails are for engaging a windshield wiper blade of the windshield wiper assembly.
The above objects are also accomplished by a rail for a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly, comprising a body portion and a detent portion, said detent portion including a cut-out on each side thereof, said cut-outs being generally symmetric with each other and forming a pair of hooks on each side of said detent portion, wherein the cut-out on one side of said detent portion is for receiving a claw of the windshield wiper assembly and the hooks on the opposite side of the detent portion are for engaging a windshield wiper blade of the windshield wiper assembly.
The above objects are also accomplished by a method of manufacturing a rail for a backing strip for a windshield wiper assembly, said method comprising the steps of forming a body member having a generally rectangular cross-section; stamping a portion of said body member to form a decreased thickness portion; and cutting out a portion of said decreased thickness portion to form a detent portion having a cut-out on each side thereof, said cut-outs being generally symmetric with each other and forming a pair of hooks on each side of said detent portion, wherein the cut-out on one side of said detent portion is for receiving a claw of the windshield wiper assembly and the hooks on the opposite side of the detent portion is for engaging a windshield wiper blade of the windshield wiper assembly
Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Referring now in detail to the accompanying drawings, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described. Referring to FIG. 1, a rail 1 includes a body portion 3 and a detent portion 5. The body 3 of the rail 1 is elongated, flat and generally rectangular in cross-section. The detent portion 5 is formed adjacent only one end of the body 3.
The rail 1 of the present invention can be formed of any material that can provide the necessary rigidity to a windshield wiper blade, while permitting the windshield wiper blade to conform to the curvature of the windshield of a vehicle. It is preferred that the rail 1 of the present invention be constructed from stainless steel; however, other materials will be readily understood to one having ordinary skill in the art.
Referring to the enlarged portion of FIG. 1, the detent portion 5 includes a pair of cut-outs 7, which form a pair of hooks 9 on each side of the detent portion 5. Referring to FIGS. 3–5 of the present invention, a rail 1 is received in a windshield wiper blade 13 of a windshield wiper assembly on each of opposite sides thereof. The windshield wiper blade 13 can also be referred to as a squeegee or rubber squeegee. Specifically, the rails 1 are received in slots 15 formed in sides of the windshield wiper blade 13. A claw 17 of the windshield wiper assembly is received in the detent portions 5 of each of the rails 1. Specifically, the outer openings 7 in each of the detent portions 5 of the rails 1 receive the claw 17 of the windshield wiper assembly, while the inner hooks 9 of the detent portion in each of the rails 1 cooperate with each other to secure the windshield wiper blade 13 therebetween.
Referring to FIGS. 2A and 3 of the present invention, the rails 1 according to the first embodiment of the present invention include hooks 9 extending outwardly from a top of the detent portion 5 and hooks 9 extending from a bottom of the detent portion 5. When the rails 1 are mounted to the windshield wiper blade 13, the top hooks 9 in one rail 1 are oriented to extend toward a center of the windshield wiper assembly and the top hooks 9 in the opposite rail 1 are oriented to extend away from the center of the windshield wiper assembly. In view of this, when the claw 15 is received within the cut-outs 7, the hooks 9 in each of the rails 1 cooperate with each other to secure the windshield wiper blade 13 therebetween.
Referring to FIG. 3, the windshield wiper blade 13 is made of a flexible material. In view of this, when the claw 17 is secured within the detent portions 5 of the rails 1, the material of the windshield wiper blade 13 flexes and the hooks 9 push into the material of the windshield wiper blade 13 to secure the windshield wiper blade 13 to the windshield wiper assembly in a secure manner. In view of this, the windshield wiper blade 13 is prevented from sliding with respect to the claw 17 and therefore the windshield wiper assembly.
It should be noted that it is preferred that the hooks 9 of the opposite rails 1 overlap each other with the material of the windshield wiper blade 13 being located therebetween. In FIG. 3, the hooks are not illustrated in overlapping manner; however, it is preferred that each of the hooks 9 of the rails 1 cross over the center line 19, so that the hooks 9 overlap each other. This provides a more secure attachment of the rails 1 to the windshield wiper blade 13.
Referring to FIG. 3, the material of the windshield wiper blade 3 bulges at 21 to permit the hooks 9 to overlap with each other when the rails are secured by the claw 17. Since the opposite rails 1 include hooks that are displaced vertically from each other, rather than aligned with each other, the material of the windshield wiper blade 13 is allowed to be displaced to form the bulges 21. This bulging of the windshield wiper blade 13 further secures the rails 1 to the windshield wiper blade 13.
Referring again to FIG. 1 of the present invention, a central portion of the detent portion 1 is formed to have a width which is greater than a width of the body 3. In view of this, when the claw 17 is mounted within the cut-outs 7 of the detent portion 5 of the rails 1, a force applied to rails 1 is increased, such that the rails 1 are pushed further inward toward the center of the windshield wiper assembly. It should be understood that increasing the width of the central portion in conjunction with decreasing the width of the claw 17 will control the amount of overlap, if any, of the hooks 9 of the cooperating rails 1.
Referring to FIG. 2B of the present invention, the second embodiment of will be described. FIG. 2B is a cross-section along the lines 2—2 of FIG. 1 and illustrates the second embodiment of the present invention which includes a top portion of the detent portion 5 having a thickness which is decreased across an entire width. In view of this, the hooks 9 on one side of the rail 1 are thicker than the hooks 9 on the opposite side of the rail 1. Accordingly, when the rails 1 according to the second embodiment of the present invention are mounted to the windshield wiper blade 13, the thicker hooks 9 on one rail cooperate with the thinner hooks of the opposite rail to secure the material of the windshield wiper blade 13 therebetween. The second embodiment of the present invention has not been illustrated in use with the windshield wiper blade 13; however, the operation can easily be understood from a review of FIG. 3.
Referring to FIG. 2C of the present invention, the third embodiment of the present invention is illustrate. FIG. 2C is also a cross-section along the line 2—2 of FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 2C, the cross-section of the detent portion 5 of the rail 1 is the same as the second embodiment of FIG. 2C, except that the hooks 9 on one side have been bent upwardly and the hooks 9 on the opposite side have been bent downwardly.
Referring to FIG. 4 of the present invention, the third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated schematically in use. Specifically, the rails 1 are mounted in the slots 15 of the windshield wiper blade 13. The rail 1 on one side of the windshield wiper blade 13 is mounted such that the hooks having an upward bend extend toward the center line 19, while the rail 1 on the opposite side is mounted such that the hooks having a downward bend extend toward the center line 19. In view of this, when the claw 17 is received within the openings 7 in each of the rails 1, the inner hooks of the rails 1 overlap each other and secure the windshield wiper blade 13 therebetween
The rail 1 according to the first embodiment of the present invention is manufactured by forming a generally rectangular base member. A portion of the base member is stamped to decrease the thickness of the base member and therefore form the base portion 3 and the decreased thickness portion which will be used for the detent portion 5.
In FIG. 2A, the stamping is carried out by a top die and a bottom die (not shown) that have raised portions to form the decreased thickness portion to have the cross-sectional shape illustrated in FIG. 2A. Specifically, the stamping is carried out to form a decreased thickness portion 23 on the bottom on one side of the detent portion 5 and a decreased thickness portion 25 on the top on the opposite side of the detent portion 5.
As an alternative, the bottom die can be flat and the top die can have raised portions to form the decreased thickness portion into the shape illustrated in FIG. 2B. Specifically, the stamping is carried out to form a decreased thickness portion 23 on one side of the detent portion 5 which is thinner than a decreased thickness portion 25 on the opposite side of the detent portion 5.
The next step in the manufacture of the rail 1 is to cut out portions of the decreased thickness portions 23, 25 on each side of the detent portion 5 to form the cut-outs 7. In FIGS. 2A and 2B, the cut-outs are formed without bending the hooks 9, while in FIG. 2C, the cut-outs are formed at the same time as the hooks on one side of the rail 1 bent upwardly and the hooks 9 on the opposite side are bent downwardly. The cutting and bending in the third embodiment of FIG. 2C can easily be performed by a die having a cutting portion and a bending portion (not shown).
Referring to FIG. 5, the first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in perspective view along with a windshield wiper blade 13. As identified by the arrow, the rail 1 is inserted into the slot 15 on each side of the windshield wiper blade 13. The inner hooks 9 of the illustrated rail 1 (the other rail is not shown) engage a bottom of the inner wall of the slot 15, since the inner hooks 9 extend from a bottom of the detent portion 5. As can be understood, the rail on the opposite side would have the inner hooks 9 extending from the top side of the detent portion 5 so that the inner rails 9 of the two rails cooperate with each other to secure the windshield wiper blade 13 therebetween. This arrangement is clearly illustrated in FIG. 3.
After the rails 1 are inserted into the slots 15, the claw 17 is secured within the outer cut-outs in each of the rails 1. This forces the inner hooks 9 to overlap with each other to strongly secure the windshield wiper blade 13 to the rails 1 to prevent sliding of the windshield wiper blade 13.
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims."

The transport belts are extended over a layering zone on an output conveyor to cover the web freshly deposited onto the output conveyor to avoid the web from being affected by harmful aerodynamic effects created by the movement of the layering arm of the cross lapper. In an embodiment, a web buffer is combined with the cross lapper such manner that the transport belts extend through web buffer.|"RELATED APPLICATION
This application claims the benefit of EP 04 008 051.7, filed on Apr. 2, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention is related to the field of producing non-woven fabric or fleece made from fiber material. More particularly, the invention relates to machinery known as a cross lapper.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
When laying a fiber web (hereinafter referred to as web) onto an output conveyor, the laying arm of the cross lapper performs a pivoting movement, wherein its lower, free end moves in close distance over the output conveyor transversely to the transport direction of the latter. If the upper end of the laying arm is pivotally attached on a pivotally mounted supply arm, the supply arm also performs a pivoting movement. A cross lapper of this type, also referred to as a camel back cross lapper, is generally known and, for instance, is described in the book “Vliesstoffe”, Verlag Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000 (page 160).
In known camel back cross lappers, the lower end of the laying arm is coupled to a carriage which is movably guided on rails transversely to the transport direction of the output conveyor. The carriage is connected to a drive means so that by the aid of this drive means, the pivoting movement of the laying arm, and possibly of the supply arm, is carried out.
The speed at which the web is discharged by the laying arm of the cross lapper may be more than 200 m/mm, but speeds in the range of 300 m/mm are desirable. The free end of the laying arm must therefore move correspondingly fast over the output conveyor to prevent disturbing the material and the creation of folds in the layered web. These high speeds lead to problems caused by aerodynamic effects. A web section layered by the laying arm may lift off its base and start fluttering under the influence of aerodynamic pull. One approach to alleviate this effect has been to provide a garnished pressure roller which felts the fibers of the freshly layered fiber web with the fibers of the web layers already layered arranged underneath. Since a laying arm usually discharges fiber web in both of its movement directions, two such pressure rollers may be mounted at the laying arm, increasing the weight of the laying arm accordingly. Further, the effect caused by such pressure rollers is relatively moderate.
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the invention to provide improved fleece laying apparatus which overcomes some of the problems and shortcomings of the prior art, including those referred to above.
Another object of the invention to provide a cross lapper capable of working at a relatively high laying speed.
Another object of the invention is to provide a cross lapper which holds the fiber web along all essentially all of its path through the cross lapper.
Another object of the invention is to provide a cross lapper which improves the quality of the fleece material produced therein.
Still another object of the invention is to provide a cross lapper which eliminates aerodynamic effects on the product manufactured.
How these and other objects are accomplished will become apparent from the following descriptions and the drawings.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The apparatus of this invention is a cross lapper for manufacturing a fiber fleece from a fiber web. The apparatus comprises: (1) a supply arm having lower and upper ends and pivotably mounted at its lower end around a stationary lower pivot axis; (2) a downwardly extending laying arm having upper and lower ends and pivotably supported at its upper end on the supply-arm upper end around an upper pivot axis parallel to the lower pivot axis, the laying-arm lower end being movable in a substantially straight path; (3) an endless output conveyor extending substantially parallel to the pivot axes and having a laying zone below the path of the laying-arm lower end; (4) two reversing rollers supported on a common carriage that is disposed below the output conveyor and is movable transversely thereto; (5) two endless transport belts juxtaposed for clamping and transporting the fiber to be layered and guided along the supply and arms for receiving a fiber web at an infeed zone and for laying the fiber web in the laying zone on the output conveyor under pivoting movement of the supply and laying arms, the juxtaposed belts forming a discharge nip at the laying-arm lower end, the belts extending beyond the nip in opposite directions transversely across the laying zone in proximity to the output conveyor, the belts being separately guided to the reversing rollers, back to the laying-arm lower end, and from there along the laying and supply arms to the infeed zone; and (6) drive apparatus for moving the belts, pivoting the supply and laying arms, and moving the output conveyor.
Preferred embodiments of the inventive cross lapper further include a pair of discharge nip rollers supported on the laying-arm lower end, and the transport belts each pass over one of the nip rollers.
In another embodiment of the inventive cross lapper, the laying-arm lower end and the carriage are connected to one another and to the drive apparatus by one of a traction rope, a toothed belt or a chain for pivoting movement of the laying and supply arms.
In a preferred embodiment, the inventive cross lapper also includes a pair of discharge nip rollers supported on the laying-arm lower end, and the transport belts each pass over one of the nip rollers.
In another preferred embodiment, the cross lapper further includes a pivot frame pivotably coupled to the laying lower end around an axis between and parallel to the nip rollers. The pivot frame is adapted to pivot such that the nip roller which is forward in the movement direction of the laying arm lower end is lifted and the other nip roller is lowered.
In a highly-preferred embodiment, the inventive cross lapper also includes web buffering apparatus disposed upstream of the supply-arm lower end, and the buffering apparatus guides the transport belts. In this embodiment, the transport belts each include feed sections and return sections. Along the feed sections, the belts, in juxtaposed fashion, transport the fiber web from a take-up site to the discharge nip, the juxtaposed belts running through a substantially U-shaped feed path portion substantially half-wrapped over a first deflecting roller. Along the return sections, the belts move from the supply arm to the take-up site guided through U-shaped return path portions oriented in directions opposite to the orientation of the U-shaped feed path portion, each belt half-wrapping one of second and third deflecting rollers, respectively. The web buffering apparatus includes a common mounting frame rotatably supporting the three deflecting rollers, thereby providing compensated length variation of the transport belts extending to and returning from the discharge nip as the laying lower end traverses the laying zone on the output conveyor.
In another preferred embodiment of the inventive cross lapper, the laying lower end and the carriage are connected to one another and to the drive apparatus by one of a traction rope, a toothed belt or a chain for pivoting movement of the laying and supply arms.
In other embodiments, the common mounting frame is movably held in a machine stand, and in some embodiments, the common mounting frame is movably held by a pendulum.
In some preferred embodiments of the inventive cross lapper, the common mounting frame is pivotably supported around the axis of the first deflecting roller.
In another preferred embodiment, the cross lapper also includes a tensioning roller about which the belt from one of the U-shaped return path portions is substantially half-wrapped, and the tensioning roller is biased away from the U-shape of such return path portion.
In other embodiments, the cross lapper of this invention further includes first and second independent drive rollers and a common drive roller, and the transport belts are each guided over one of the independent drive rollers and their feed sections are commonly guided over the common drive roller. In these embodiments, the common drive roller is driven at a circumferential speed that is variable with respect to the circumferential speeds of the first and second independent drive rollers, thus varying the discharge speed of the cross lapper with respect to its take-up speed.
In another embodiments, the cross lapper further includes first and second independent drive rollers, the transport belts each being guided over one of the independent drive rollers, and the first deflecting roller is also a driven roller driven at a circumferential speed that is variable with respect to the circumferential speeds of the first and second independent drive rollers; thus the discharge speed of the cross lapper is varied with respect to its take-up speed.
In another preferred embodiment, the inventive cross lapper further includes two return drive rollers, and each of the return sections between the supply arm and the U-shaped return path portions wrap at least 90° around a respective one of the return drive rollers.
In highly preferred embodiments, the supply and laying arms each have guide rollers alternatingly contacting opposite sides of the juxtaposed feed sections of the transport belts.
In other highly preferred embodiments, the inventive cross lapper further includes two return drive rollers, each of the return sections between the supply arm and the U-shaped return path portions wrap at least 90° around a respective one of the return drive rollers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
FIG. 1 shows a cross lapper 1 with a supply arm 2 and a laying arm 3. The supply arm 2 is pivotally supported on its lower end in a lower, stationary pivot axis 4. laying arm 3 is pivotably supported in an upper pivot axis 5 on the upper end 2U of supply arm 2. The lower (free) end 3L of laying arm 3 is movably guided above an output conveyor 6 which has a transport direction which extends in parallel to pivot axes 4 and 5. Lower end 3L of the laying arm 3 is coupled to a pivot frame 7 which is guided in rails (not shown) which extend transversely across output conveyor 6 on both sides of a laying zone.
Traction ropes, toothed belts or chains 8 are attached onto pivot frame 7 and are guided over a plurality of deflection wheels 9 supported in a frame (not shown) around output conveyor 6. One or a pair of wheels 9, designated by reference number 9a, is driven by a motor (not shown). So configured, pivot frame 7 can be moved back and forth transversely to output conveyor 6. Both supply arm 2 and laying arm 3, arm 3 being coupled with pivot frame 7, each carry out pivoting movements.
Two endless transport belts 10 and 11, transporting a fiber web (not shown) to be layered, are guided over supply arm 2 and laying arm 3 and around output conveyor 6 in the area of the laying zone. Transport belts 10 and 11 determine a feeding path section in which transport belts 10 and 11 are guided in parallel between a take-up site A, at which the web is supplied, and a discharge nip B at lower end 3L of the laying arm 3. Thus, transport belts 10 and 11 are capable of sandwiching a fiber web between them and of supporting the web. This feeding path section extends from take-up site A via a reversing roller 12, a driven reversing roller 13, a deflection roller 14 close to lower pivot axis 4, over supply arm 2 and another deflection roller 15 supported at the upper pivot axis 5, and up to discharge nip B at lower end 3L of the laying arm 3. (The apparatus shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 contain numerous deflecting, reversing, and drive rollers which will be specified primarily by reference number only and not by differentiating names.) Discharge nip B comprises two deflecting rollers 16 and 17 which are supported on pivot frame 7 at which lower end 3L of laying arm 3 is articulated.
Starting at discharge nip B, the paths of transport belts 10 and 11 separate. In the example shown in FIG. 1, web transport belt 10 extends transversely over output conveyor 6 and two deflecting rollers 18 up to a reversing roller 19. Roller 19 is supported in a lower carriage 20, which is positioned below output conveyor 6. Carriage 20 can be moved on rails (not shown) transverse to output conveyor 6. Reversing roller 19 reverses the direction of transport belt 10. Belt 10 then runs over deflecting rollers 21 back to lower end 3L of the laying arm 3. At this point, belt 10 passes over another deflecting roller 22 and moves to a deflecting roller 23 located above upper pivot axis 5. Belt 10 then moves along supply arm 2 to a deflecting roller 24, a drive roller 25, two further reversing rollers 26 and 27, and a drive roller 28 located in the area of take-up site A. In this manner, the running path of web transport belt 10 is completed.
Web transport belt 11 runs from discharge nip B at lower end 3L of laying arm 3 via deflecting rollers 18 and below output conveyor 6 to a reversing roller 29. From reversing roller 29, belt 11 runs back via deflecting rollers 21A to a deflecting roller 30 mounted close to lower end 3L of laying arm 3, along laying arm 3 to a deflecting roller 31 located below upper pivot axis 5, along supply arm 2 and over a deflecting roller 42 arranged close to lower pivot axis 4 to a drive roller 32. Belt 11 then moves over a pair of reversing rollers 33 and 34 to a drive roller 35 located in the region of take-up site A. In this manner, the path of web transport belt 11 is completed.
FIG. 1 shows the cross lapper with supply arm 2 and laying arm 3 in a retracted position. Pivot frame 7, supporting deflecting rollers 16 and 17 at discharge nip B, is located in FIG. 1 on the left side of output conveyor 6. In this situation, lower carriage 20 supporting reversing rollers 19 and 29 is located on the right, underneath the output conveyor 6. Comparing FIG. 1 to FIG. 2, in which laying arm 2 and supply arm 3 are extended, it can be seen that by a displacement of pivot frame 7 to the right, lower carriage 20 is moved to the left by the same displacement. Corresponding to the additional length of transport belt 10 moved onto the upper side of the laying zone caused by this movement, lower carriage 20 has moved to the left, and at the same time provided a corresponding length of transport belt 11, which is supported by the coupling of traction ropes, toothed belts or chains 8 to the lower carriage 20.
When moving lower end 3L of laying arm 3 from the position shown in FIG. 1 into the position shown in FIG. 2, deflecting roller 16 supported on pivot frame 7 is rolling on web transport belt 11 layered by roller 16 if the speed at which web transport belt 10 is driven by its drive roller 32 is as high as the movement speed of pivot frame 7. Since the fiber web is discharged at this speed from discharge nip B, the section of web transport belt 11 resting on the freshly layered web does not have a relative speed with respect to the web (except for the movement of output conveyor 6 transverse to the laying direction of laying arm 3). During this movement, transport belt 10 has a speed relative to speed at take-up site A zone which consists of the sum of the running speed of pivot frame 7 and the supply speed of transport belt 10. The same applies to transport belts 10 and 11 for movement of pivot frame 7 in the reverse direction. Practice has shown that this relative speed between the layered fleece and transport belts 10 and 11 covering the layered fleece does not lead to problems. As mentioned above, pivot frame 7 is pivoted with respect to laying arm 3 around a horizontal axis, so that the deflecting roller (16 or 17) which is in front in the moving direction, is slightly lifted.
The section located between take-up site A and an infeed zone C at the lower end of supply arm 2 of the structure shown forms web buffering apparatus 36. On the way back from discharge nip B to take-up site A, transport belt 10, after leaving supply arm 2, runs over drive roller 25 and from there into a substantially U-shaped return path portion the apex of which is formed by reversing roller 26. Belt 10 continues over another reversing roller 27 and drive roller 28 to take-up site A.
On its way back to take-up site A, after leaving supply arm 2, transport belt 11 also runs over drive roller 32 into substantially U-shaped return path portion, the apex of which is formed by reversing roller 33. From there, belt 11 continues over a tensioning roller 34 and drive roller 35 which is located at the take-up site A.
Reversing rollers 26 and 33 located in the path of transport belts 10 and 11 and forming the apexes of the U-shaped return path portions, are rotatably supported in a common mounting frame 37 on which reversing roller 12 is also supported and around which the web transporting sections of transport belts 10 and 11 are guided as a pair, in juxtaposed fashion. Common mounting frame 37 is pivotally attached at the axis of reversing roller 12 at a frame-shaped link 38, which is only schematically shown in the drawing with a dash-dotted line. Link 38 is suspended like a pendulum in a pivot bearing 41 in machine stand M (shown in dotted line format only in FIG. 1) of the cross lapper.
Tensioning roller 34 is mounted on the piston of a hydraulic cylinder 39 attached to machine stand M. The force exerted by hydraulic cylinder 39 onto tensioning roller 34 tensions transport belt 11. The tension is transferred over reversing roller 33 and through common mounting frame 37, which acts as a two-armed lever by pivoting around the axis of reversing roller 12. The tension is further transferred over reversing roller 26 carried by common mounting frame 37 to the returning section of transport belt 10. Thus, both web transport belts 10 and 11 are tensioned by single hydraulic cylinder 39.
On their way over the arms 2 and 3 the transport belts 10 and 11 run over several guide rollers 40 supported on the feeding and laying arms 2 and 3, some of the guide rollers alternatingly contacting on the one and the other side of the paired transport belt section to prevent fluttering of the transport belts on the arms 2 and 3.
Various operating states will now be described. As long as drive rollers 13, 25, 28, 32 and 35 have identical circumferential speeds, common mounting frame 37 stays in the position shown in FIG. 1. If the circumferential speed of drive roller 13 becomes higher than that of the other drive rollers, drive roller 13 pulls common mounting frame 37, through paired transport belts 10 and 11 and reversing roller 12, to the left in FIG. 1, causing the length of the web transporting sections of transport belts 10 and 11 to shorten. At the same time, the length of the returning sections of transport belts 10 and 11 increases since reversing rollers 26 and 33 are also moved to the left. Positions of rollers 12, 26 and 33 moved to the left are shown in dotted lines in the drawing by reference numbers 12′, 26′ and 33′, respectively.
If, however, the drive speed of drive roller 13 becomes lower than the speed of the other drive rollers, common mounting frame 37 moves to the right (in FIG. 1) so that reversing rollers 12, 36 and 33 reach the positions shown in FIG. 1 by reference numbers 12″, 26″ and 33″, respectively. Since the displacement of the reversing rollers 12, 26 and 33 takes place in essentially equal amounts, transport belts 10 and 11 remain tensioned.
By the aid of the movement of common mounting frame 37, the length of transport belts 10 and 11 between take-up site A and discharge nip B can be varied. Thus, it is possible to temporarily change the speed of the web discharge at discharge nip B compared to the web infeed speed at take-up site A. This change is required for cross lapper 1, since the speed at which discharge nip B, i.e., the pivot frame 7, moves over output conveyor 6, cannot be constant, since in the area of the movement reversal points of laying arm 3, its speed must be reduced by braking to zero and then accelerated in the opposite direction after the reversal of the movement. If during these braking and accelerating phases transport belts 10 and 11 continue to discharge web through discharge nip B, web thickening would result in the marginal area of the fiber web by the cross lapper, and such variations must be prevented. Thus it is necessary to vary the speed at which the web is discharged by transport belts 10 and 11, adapting to the speed at which pivot frame 7 moves over output conveyor 6. This variation of the discharge speed of the web from discharge nip B can be managed by suitable control of the speed of drive rollers 13, 25 and 32 with respect to the speed of drive rollers 28 and 35, wherein frame 37 carries out a substantially oscillating movement around pivot bearing 41. This oscillating movement moves reversing rollers 12, 26 and 33 between positions 12′, 26′ and 33′ on the one hand and positions 12″, 26″ and 33″ on the other hand, and thereby cyclically changes the buffered web volume.
The structure of web buffering apparatus 36 shown can also fulfill another task. For this purpose another movement component of common mounting frame 37 will now be explained with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2. FIG. 2 shows cross lapper 1 with supply arm 2 and laying arm 3 in an extended position. It can readily be seen in FIG. 2 that the wrapping angles of transport belts 10 and 11 on deflecting rollers 15, 23 and 31, which are arranged in arms 2 and 3 in the region of upper pivot axis 5, and on deflecting rollers 14, 24 and 42, which are arranged in the region of lower pivot axis 4 of supply arm 2, vary from the wrapping angles shown in FIG. 1. While the change of the wrapping angles of the paired web transport belt sections and also the change of the wrapping angles at deflecting rollers 23 and 31 do not have opposite influences on web transport belts 10 and 11 as far the return sections thereof are concerned, the wrapping angle of the return section of belt 10 on deflecting roller 24 in FIG. 2 is smaller with respect to that in FIG. 1, whereas the wrapping angle of the returning section of belt 11 on deflecting roller 42 is greater than in FIG. 1. Such wrapping angles of web transport belts 10 and 11 therefore change in opposite directions. Transport belt 10 requires an increase in the running path length of its return section, while transport belt 11 requires a decrease in the running path length of its return section. Both can be achieved by the aid of tensioning roller 34, influenced by the hydraulic cylinder 39, which, in FIG. 2 presses the tensioning roller 34 to the right, resulting in common mounting frame 37 being pivoted from its position shown in FIG. 1 in counter-clockwise direction on link 38 into the position shown in FIG. 2. The length of the returning section of transport belt 11 is decreased, and at the same time, the length of the returning section of transport belt 10 is increased.
It is obvious that the movement of common mounting frame 37 around pivot bearing 41 of link 38 and the pivoting movement of common mounting frame 37 on link 38 around the axis of roller 12 reversing paired web transport belts 10 and 11, superimpose on one another during operation, since the compensation of the speed difference of the transport belts 10 and 11 at discharge nip B and take-up site A and the compensation of the change of the roller wrapping angles in opposite directions must take place simultaneously.
As an example of a practical embodiment of the invention, the laying width is 3,500 mm. The length of arms 2 and 3 between deflecting roller 31 and the ends of the arms is 2,800 mm each. Transport belts 2 and 3 each have a length of 21,500 mm. The movement path of lower end 3L of laying arm 3 of camel back cross lapper 1 is 4,000 mm. In the retracted condition of arms 2 and 3 (FIG. 1), arms 2 and 3 include an angle of approximately 27°, whereas in the extended position (FIG. 2), arms 2 and 3 include an angle of approximately 133°. The difference in the yielding of transport belts 10 and 11 which is caused by the change of the wrapping angles on deflecting rollers 24 and 42 (in turn caused by the different arm positions during extension), is compensated by an adjustment of approximately 20 mm on tensioning roller 34 by hydraulic cylinder 39. Frame-like link 38, at which common mounting frame 37 is suspended, has an effective length (pendulum length) of 1,400 mm, whereas the distance of reversing rollers 26 and 33 on the common mounting frame 37 from reversing roller 12 common to the transport belts is 520 mm each. For accommodating web buffering apparatus 36, a space of approximately 2,100 mm in front of the camel back cross lapper 1 and a height of approximately 1,740 mm is required, including link arrangement 31.
A variety of alternatives are possible and are obvious to the person skilled in the art of the present invention. For instance, reversing roller 12 supported on common mounting frame 37 may serve as a drive roller, whereas roller 13 may serve as an idling reversing roller. Furthermore, reversing rollers 26 and 33 supported on common mounting frame 37 may be drive rollers, with rollers 25 and 32 serving as idling deflecting rollers. Common mounting frame 37 could be pivotally supported in a movable carriage instead of being suspended on link 38. Furthermore, cross lapper 1 could have four or more hinged arms in order to achieve a larger laying width without increasing height, such hinged arms being arranged and movable in accordion-like fashion. In such case, the movement of the arms would be coordinated with movement of the laying arm. In an arrangement of this type, transport belts 10 and 11 would be guided in pairs over all of the arms articulated to one another so that the fiber web is permanently sandwiched between two tightly contacting transport belts across its entire feeding path.
The integration of web buffering apparatus, web guidance over the supply and laying arms, and the covering of the layered web on the output conveyor by using a single pair of transport belts offers excellent advantages over the prior art not only in view of the cost of the apparatus but also in view of the quality of the product produced. The fiber web to be layered for producing a fleece is held in this integrated device in uninterrupted fashion between the web transport belts from the take-up site to the discharge nip. The fiber web is free from mechanical loads caused by free suspension, by tensioning, and by transfer from one transport belt to the other. Such freedom from mechanical loads is not available in cross lappers which work with several movable carriages. This careful and conservative treatment of the fiber web is continued after leaving the discharge nip, since the web is accompanied by one of the transport belts, namely the transport belt that covers it directly after leaving the discharge nip. The web rests on a support and is free from exposure to unfavorable aerodynamic forces as well.
While the principles of the invention have been shown and described in connection with specific embodiments, it is to be understood that such embodiments are by way of example and are not limiting."

SPECIFICATION
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The invention relates to a reclining table comprising a stationary reclining plate and a back rest pivotally connected to it, with means being provided for supporting the back rest in a number of angular positions in relation to the reclining plate.
2. Description of Related Art
Such a reclining table is known from U.S. Pat. No. 6,003,174. This concerns a reclining table for a patient whose head is to be examined in a scanning device. There, the back rest is connected to a pivot shaft, which is rotatably supported by the reclining plate. With this reclining plate gear wheels are connected having their axes coinciding with the axis of the pivot shaft. The back rest is provided with spring-biased pins, each being pushed into one of the teeth of the accompanying gear wheel in order to support the pivot shaft and with it, the back rest, in a certain position.
For adjusting the back rest, the pins must be pulled out of the teeth of the gear wheels, which is effected by a rod extending parallel to the pivot shaft being connected to the back rest.
It is obvious, that considerable forces are exerted on the pivot shaft, and thus on the pins as well. The structure must be designed for this and is therefore relatively heavy and complicated. Nevertheless it is suited for the intended purpose, since the patient's head must be brought into a relatively small opening of the device concerned.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The object of the invention is to provide a reclining table of the above-mentioned type which is simple in construction and easy to operate.
According to the invention, to that end, the reclining plate of the reclining table is provided with a supporting member which is pivotally connected to the reclining plate near the location where the free end of the back rest will be positioned near the free end of the reclining plate when the back rest is in the almost horizontal position, said supporting member being provided with means for supporting the back rest in a number of angular positions up to a maximum angular position, and in which said supporting member can be folded down onto the reclining plate when not in use, and further a supporting plate is provided, which is pivotally connected to the back rest in a position spaced from its free end and which can cooperate with said means provided on the reclining plate for supporting the back rest in a number of angles, said angles being greater than the first-mentioned, maximum angle, and in which said supporting plate can be pivoted against the back rest.
In this way, it is achieved, that both of the supporting member and the supporting plate can be pivoted against the reclining plate and the back rest, respectively, in such a way that the back rest can take up the almost horizontal position, if desired.
With the structure according to the invention, it is also achieved, that the supporting member can be of a relatively limited length. Namely, the supporting member only has to support the back rest across a relatively small angle. Should the back rest have to be adjusted across a greater angle, then the supporting member will be folded down and its function will be taken over by the supporting plate.
This can be particularly important when the reclining table with the back rest is used in examining a patient by means of X-rays or other similar rays. There, it is desirable, that the radiation is hindered as less as possible by parts of the structure on which the patient lies.
The relatively limited length of the supporting member will generally allow it to be outside the area of the radiation in the collapsed state, too.
According to the invention, it can be particularly provided for, that the means cooperating with the supporting member, during its use, will extend beyond the free end edge of the back rest.
When the back rest is adjusted to relatively small angles by means of the supporting member, the supporting member will project beyond the back rest. In order to limit the distance across which the supporting member projects beyond the back rest, said supporting member, after achieving the maximum angle, will be pivoted onto the reclining plate. For adjusting the back rest to a greater angle, one will then switch over to use of the supporting plate.
In particular, the supporting plate can be provided with the means that can cooperate with the supporting member, said means extending outside the back rest when the supporting plate has been pivoted against the back rest, in such a way that the free end edge of the supporting plate is near the free end edge of the back rest.
The means allowing for the cooperation between the supporting member and the supporting plate can be formed by lateral slots provided in the supporting member and lips connected to the free end of the supporting plate which can be received in the lateral slots.
The means mounted on the reclining plate for supporting the back rest across a number of angles can be formed by a number of slots provided behind one another across the length of the reclining plate, in which the free end edge of the supporting plate can be received.
In particular, the slots will be provided in pairs and spaced-apart, in such a way that the lips connected to the supporting plate will be able to cooperate with the slots when using the supporting plate.
In order to avoid weakening of the reclining plate, the slots will be provided in blocks, that are fastened onto the reclining plate, said blocks being at such a distance from one another, that the supporting member can lie between them, the width of the lips connected to the supporting plate being such, that they can cooperate with both the supporting member and said slots.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING
The invention will now be explained further by way of an embodiment, illustrated in the drawings, in which:
FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of a part of a reclining table according to the invention, which particularly shows the part having the adjustable back rest, the back rest taking up a certain angle with the help of the supporting member;
FIG. 2 shows a perspective view according to FIG. 1, yet seen from a lower position;
FIG. 3 shows a perspective view with the back rest in a certain angle with the help of the supporting plate;
FIGS. 4 and 5 show side views of the reclining table in which the back rest is held in two different angles using the supporting member; and
FIGS. 6 and 7 show side views of the reclining table in which the back rest is held in two different angles using the supporting plate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
The reclining table 1, shown only partly in the drawings, comprises a stationary reclining plate 2 and a back rest 3 pivotally connected to it. The reclining plate 2 can be part of the reclining table 1 or can be connected to it.
By means of pivots 4, a supporting member 5 is connected to the reclining plate 2 near the location where the free end 6 of the back rest 3 will be situated near the free end 7 of the reclining plate 2 when the back rest 3 is in its almost horizontal position.
As appears in particular from FIGS. 1 and 2, said supporting member 5 is provided with lateral slots 8 into which lips 9 provided at the free end edge 10 of a supporting plate 11, can be received. Supporting plate 11 is connected to the back rest 3 by means of pivots 12.
FIG. 2 shows that said supporting member 5 can cooperate with supporting plate 11 in such a way, that the back rest 3 can be adjusted to a first angle of 5° and in subsequent steps of 2,5°. The maximum angle will be 15°.
When one wishes to adjust the back rest 3 at an angle greater than 15°, use is made of the supporting plate 11 and the supporting member 5 is folded down onto the reclining plate 2 as illustrated in FIG. 3.
As likewise shown in FIG. 3, lips 9 connected to the supporting plate 11 are now received in slots 13, which are provided in blocks 14 connected to the reclining plate 2. The mutual distance between the blocks 13 is such, that the back rest 3 is adjustable across subsequent almost equal angles.
FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate two different angular positions of the back rest 3 using the supporting member 5. Now said lateral slots 8 of supporting member 5 cooperate with the lips 9 of the supporting plate 11.
FIGS. 6 and 7 show two different angular positions of the back rest 3 using the supporting plate 11, its lips 9 cooperating with the slots 13 in the blocks 14.
When the back rest 3 must be brought into the most horizontal position, the supporting plate 11 will be pivoted from the position shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, in such a way, that it will engage the other part of the back rest.
Although above, a “reclining table” is discussed, it might also be of a limited length. Thus, then one could think of a reclining chair.
It will be obvious, that only one exemplary embodiment of a reclining table with back rest according to the invention is shown in the drawing and described above and that many modifications can be made without leaving the scope of the invention, as this is indicated in the claims."

BACKGROUND OF PRIOR ART
Continuous swimming tanks are known generally. German Patent No. 2,222,594 issued to Hoppe shows a continuous swimming tank. In the tank described therein, water circulates from the front of a swimming area past the swimmer to the rear of the swimming area where it is recalculated through a duct which runs beneath the floor of the swimming area. One set of turning vanes directs the water from the swimming area to the recirculation duct. The water passes over a propeller located in the duct and used for circulation. The second set of turning vanes directs the water from the recirculation duct back into the front of the swimming area.
The swimming area shown in the German '594 patent widens from the front of the tank to the rear of the tank. That is, the cross-sectional area of the swimming area increases from the front to the rear of the tank. This results in velocity variations over the length of the tank. The velocity of the flowing water is greater at the front of the swimming area than it is at the rear of the swimming area. Thus, a swimmer may choose where to swim, according to water velocity. The flow rate of water is constant anywhere in a given cross-section, perpendicular to the direction of water flow. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
The problem with such a design is that it requires a large swimming area and thus a large swimming tank. Further, a large motor and great deal of power is required to circulate such a large volume of water.
U.S. Pat. No. 2,035,835 issued to Raber for “Swimming Bath” shows a continuous swimming tank. In this reference, water is circulated either beneath the floor of the swimming area or around the sides of the swimming area. No turning vanes are used to direct the water. The problem with such a tank is that large amounts of turbulence are developed, and loss of water velocity results. Therefore, more power is needed to circulate the water, and swimming comfort is adversely affected by the turbulence. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,021 issued to James Murdock for a “Continuous swimming apparatus” discloses and claims swim treadmill which is said to avoid the power and size shortcomings of the prior art by providing a compact swimming apparatus. The apparatus consists essentially of a tank adapted to contain water and having a swimming area within the tank. Water flows through the swimming area from a water entrance end to a water exit end and returns to the water entrance end via a return path. Water circulation means is included in the return path for propelling the water through the return path and through the swimming area. A plurality of vanes is located in the return path to direct the water from the return path to the entrance end of the swimming area and from the exit end of the swimming area to the return path. The vanes help to minimize power losses by minimizing water turbulence. The vanes are spaced in such a way as to create a horizontal velocity gradient across the swimming area whereby water closer to the center of the swimming area has a higher velocity than water near the sides of the swimming area. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
Additional prior art of interest include U.S. Pat. No. 1,731,554 issued to M. I. Wheeler for “Swimming Pool” and U.S. Pat. No. 722,232 issued to Hoeglauer for “Bathtub”. The preceding prior art is incorporated by reference herein.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a simplified perspective view of the major components comprising the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein. As shown, the pool is comprised of an externally positioned power system used to drive a hydraulic system which is connected by hydraulic hoses to and drives a water propulsion system. See FIG. 1. The quality of the water used is maintained by the water quality system which continually processes a slipstream of the water contained within the self-contained swimming pool. See FIG. 1.
The propulsion system is mounted at a first end of the self-contained swimming pool for containment of water and generation of water current flows. The water current flows delivered from the first end to the second end of the pool for exercise, therapy and or rehabilitation of a user. During operation, the user typically faces the propulsion unit. The self-contained exercise pool is sized so that during operation a user may swim or exercise against the current generated by the propulsion system. The inner water containment area is created by a rigid frame around the outer perimeter therein. A set of water return channels within intake ports at the second end of the pool allow the return of the water current flows back to the propulsion system. To maximize user functionality, a seating surface has been placed upon the water return channels to allow for user seating on either side of the water current flows.
As illustrated in FIGS. 1, 4 and 7, the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein may be adapted for various types and sizes of top decorative surfaces including an eight (8″) inch walk-way as shown at FIGS. 2-4 and a two foot (2′) walkway as shown at FIGS. 7-9. As required by local regulations, the self-contained exercise pool as described herein may be adapted for grounding through installation of grounding straps along the bottom portion of the tension straps.
FIGS. 4-6 illustrate the steel supports of the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein. FIG. 10 illustrates the tension straps of the self-contained exercise pool disclosed and claimed herein. The combination of the modular steel supports shown at FIG. 4 or FIG. 9 and the tension straps of FIG. 10 produce an interlocking frame structure of sufficient rigidity during operation that tile may be used as the top decorative surface. (See FIG. 11) The choice of tile for the top decorative surface improves the overall aesthetic of the self-contained exercise pool increasing user desirability.
The hydraulic pumping system is exteriorly mounted and also self-contained. The hydraulic pumping system has an electrically driven pump to circulate the glycol based pumping solution through hydraulic hoses connected to the propulsion system. The glycol solution chosen is non-toxic to humans and animals. Although the system as designed to minimize the potential for glycol to enter the water of the pool, however, if the glycol material does enter the water within the inner containment area, it is easily separated from the water through the filtration system of the pool. See FIG. 1. Because electrical pumping systems as well as hydraulic systems are well known in the art, further discussion is unnecessary as related to the present art.
It is well known in the prior art to use vegetable oil as the hydraulic fluid to drive the propulsion system. The problem with using vegetable oil as the hydraulic fluid is that if it introduced into the pool at any time, such as through leakage or spillage, the vegetable oil is immiscible with the water forming a separate layer. The vegetable oil forms a coating or film upon the inner layer of the pool. Furthermore, the filtration system of the prior art is not equipped to remove the vegetable oil from the water. Typically, the operator must remove the contents of the pool and thoroughly wash the unit which requires almost complete disassembly of the pool unit and its component parts so they may be washed down with soap and water prior to re-assembly.
The glycol based pumping solution of the present embodiment is designed for low maintenance and long use. Typically, viscosity breakdown of the glycol solution is of major concern to the prior art. The present system addresses this problem by maintaining a relatively constant temperature of the pumping solution by using a heat exchanger positioned in the inner water circulation area to allow transfer of any excess heat built up in the pumping solution to be transferred to the circulated water. (Not shown) This innovation solves the viscosity breakdown problem. The glycol solution, should it be mixed into the water, through leakage or spillage, is easily removed the existing filtration system. Minor hydraulic fluid leaks of the glycol water solution are hardly noticed by the user. Major glycol leaks into the water of the pool typically present a cloudy appearance which is easily corrected by draining the pool, fixing the leak and refilling the pool with water. No disassembly of the pool or its major components is necessary.
It is therefore an objective of the present invention to create a self-enclosed swimming pool for use as a water treadmill for use in exercise or rehabilitation.
It is another objective of the present invention for the self-enclosed swimming pool to be self-supporting.
It is another objective of the present invention for the rigid frame of the self-enclosed swimming pool to be modular in design to allow for improved delivery and assembling.
It is also an objective of the present invention for the self-enclosed swimming pool to drive the propulsion system with a hydraulic system with a solution which is non-toxic to both humans and pets.

2012_08201270.xml|08201270|20120619|Clark Hill PLC|Leg protector and protective skirt including a leg protector|3765|10|utility|A protective skirt for use in martial arts provides leg protectors for providing protection to the thighs of the user in the event of a full-forced attack to the thighs. The leg protectors are removable elements allowing the skirt to be used with out the leg protectors. Alternatively, the leg protectors can be integrated with the skirt.|"FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention is generally directed to a protective device for use in connection with martial arts.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Often the practice of martial arts involves weapons lighting such as, for example, kendo (Japanese) and kumdo (Korean) sword fighting. In such practice, devices, for example, armor are used to protect the head, the body, and the hand/wrist. These devices allow the practitioner to practice the full extent of their art by allowing the practitioner to strike with full force while avoiding injury to the practitioner's partner. In the practice of sword fencing in kendo and kumdo for instance, a bamboo sword is used to strike the following areas: the head (men-Japanese/mori-Korean), the wrist (kote-Japanese/son-Korean), the waist (do-Japanese/hori-Korean), and the throat (tsuki-Japanese/mok-Korean) and the traditional armor 10 as shown in FIG. 1 is made to protect these areas. The traditional armor 10 generally includes a helmet 12, a chest plate 14, gloves 16, and a skirt 20. The skirt 20 protects the hips and legs in case of a slip from the strike to the waist. The skirt 20 (“tare” in Japanese and “kapsang” in Korean) is constructed from heavy canvas. Because the hips and thighs are not “legal” targets in sword fighting, the skirt provides only moderate protection but does not protect against a full-forced attack.
The skirt 20 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 2. The skirt 20 includes a belt 22 and a plurality of primary panels 24 and secondary panels 26 extending from the belt. The primary panels 24 overlap the secondary panels 26. The skirt 20 includes ties 28 extending from either end of the belt 22. To wear the skirt 20, the user positions the belt 22 such that the secondary panels 26 are proximate the body. The belt 22 is wrapped around the user's waist to provide primary and secondary panels 24, 26 extending in front of and behind the user. The ties 28 are crossed behind the user and then brought together in front of the user where they are tied together to secure the skirt 20 to the user. The secured ties 28 are positioned under one of the panels 24 of the skirt to avoid in advertent untying of the skirt 20.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Briefly, the present invention discloses a leg protector for attachment to the skirt 20 to provide a protective skirt including a leg protector which protects the thighs of the user from a full-forced attack during sword fighting.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT
While the invention may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail, a specific embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that as illustrated and described herein.
As shown in FIG. 3 the present invention provides a protective skirt 30 which provides protection of the user's legs during sword fighting or stick fighting sports in which the rules and method of play allow for full-forced strikes to the legs. A new sword fighting sport which allows for such full-forced strikes to the legs has been named by its creator as “Gumtoogi” and a new stick fighting sport allowing for such strikes has been named by its creator as “Bongtoogi”. The protective skirt 30 includes a left leg protector 32 and a right leg protector 34 each of which provides a strike panel to protect the users upper legs and in particular the thighs in the event of a full-forced attack, allowing these areas to become primary targets. The protective skirt 30 can be provided by adapting the skirt 20 shown in FIG. 2.
The protective skirt 30 is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 4 and 5. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the protective skirt 30 is provided by modifying the skirt 20. Each leg protector 32, 34 includes a sock 36 and a shield 38. The leg protectors 32, 34 are identical to one another and therefore only the leg protector 32 will be described in detail with the understanding that the same description applies to the leg protector 34.
As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the sock 36 is generally tubularly-shaped with a generally oval cross-section to generally provide a front portion 39 and a rear portion 40. The sock 36 generally includes an outer surface 42, an inner surface 44, an upper end face 46, and a lower end face 48. A panel passage 50 is defined by the sock 36 for receiving a panel 24 of the skirt as will be described herein. An attachment mechanism 52 is provided on the outer surface 42 of the sock 36 at the front portion 39 and a pair of attachment mechanisms 54 is provided on the outer surface 42 of the sock 36 at the rear portion 40. The attachment mechanisms 52, 54 are for example, mating hook and loop type fasteners. The dimensions of the sock 36 will vary depending upon the size of the user. The dimension of the sock 36 may, for example, have a width of approximately 6⅞″ and a height of approximately 10⅛″.
The shield 38 is best shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. The shield 38 generally includes a strike panel 60 and support straps 62. The strike panel 60 is generally trapezoidally-shaped and includes a front surface 64, a rear surface 66, an upper end 68 and a lower end 70. The width of the upper end 68 is smaller than the width of the lower end 70. A plurality of slats 72 are mounted to the front surface 64 of the strike panel 60. The slats 72 are made, for example, from bamboo or plastic. The slats 72 are attached to the strike panel 60 with, for example, leather string 74. An attachment mechanism 76 such as, for example, a loop and hook-type fastener is provided on the rear surface 66 of the strike panel 60 for attachment of the shield 38 to the sock 36 as will be described herein. The shield is preferably formed from heavy cotton canvas and filed with padding. The dimensions of the strike panel will vary depending upon the size of the user. The dimensions of the strike panel may, for example have a width of approximately 6.5 to 6.75 inches at the upper end, a width of approximately 10″ to 10.75″ at the lower end, and a height of approximately 15.5″ to 18″.
The support straps 62 extend upwardly from the upper end 68 of the strike panel 60. Lower ends 78 of the straps 62 are attached to the strike panel 60 and upper ends 80 of the straps are free. Attachment mechanisms 82 are provided on the rear surface of the upper ends 80 of the straps 62. The attachment mechanisms 82 are, for example, hook and loop-type fasteners.
As shown in FIG. 10, attachment of the leg protectors 32 to skirt 20 begins by sliding a primary panel 24 of the skirt 20 in panel passage 50 of the sock 36. The sock 36 is slid upwardly on the panel 24 until the upper end 46 of the sock 36 is proximate the belt 22 of the skirt 20, as shown in FIG. 11. The sock 36 is sized relative to the primary panel 24 such that a friction fit is provided between the inner surface 44 of the sock 36 and the panel 24 of the skirt 20. The sock 36 is mounted to the panel 24 so that the attachment mechanism 52 of the front portion 39 of sock 36 is directed away from the user.
Next, as shown in FIG. 12, the shield 38 of the leg protector 32 is mounted to the sock 36 by mating the attachment mechanism 76 on the rear surface 66 of the leg protector 32 to the attachment mechanism 52 on the front portion 39 of the sock 36. As shown in FIG. 13, the support straps 62 are then wrapped over the belt 22 of the skirt 20 and downwardly. The attachment mechanisms at 82 the free ends 80 of the straps 62 are then mated with the attachment mechanisms 54 on the rear portion of the sock 36 to secure the shield 38 to the skirt 20.
Attachment of the leg protectors 32, 34 to the skirt 20 therefore provides a protective skirt which not only protects the user from inadvertent hits to the legs, but also provides for protection from full-forced attacks to the legs. The skirt 30, therefore includes protection to the upper legs as is necessary for the sport of Gumtoogi and Bongtoogi. In addition, the skirt 30 allows for removal of the leg protectors 32, 34 should the user choose to remove them, for example for use in Kendo or Kumdo. The removable leg protectors 32, 34 therefore eliminate the need for the user to purchase different skirts for each sport. Although hook and loop type fasteners and a sock 36 were described for attaching the shield of the leg protector to the skirt 20, other methods of attaching the leg protector are within the scope of the invention. For example, snaps may be used to mate the shields 38 to the sock 36. Alternatively the leg protectors could be tied to the skirt 20 to provide the protective skirt 30.
Although the skirt 30 has been described as including removable leg protectors 32, 34, it is to be understood that the leg protectors 32, 34 can also be permanently integrated in the skirt 30. In the case of permanent attachment of the leg protectors 32, 34, the sock 36 is not required and attachment mechanisms 52, 54, 76 and 82 are not required. Rather, the leg protectors 32, 34 are permanently attached to the belt 22 of the skirt 30 by, for example, sewing the leg protector 32, 34 to the belt 22 or to the panels 24 of the skirt 30.
Although the leg protectors have been described as being formed from heavy cotton canvas material, it is to be understood that a variety of materials can be used to form the leg protectors so long as the material serves to sufficiently protect the legs of the user from full-forced attacks to the legs, allowing the legs to become viable targets.
While preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims."
2013_08356370.xml|08356370|20130122|Warren M. Pate, LLC|Dynamic hammock spreader apparatus and method|3673|19|utility|A method for spreading a hammock is disclosed. The method may include selecting a hammock comprising a hammock base having a first end, a second end opposite the first end in a longitudinal direction, a first side, and a second side opposite the first side in a lateral direction. The method may further include suspending the first end of the hammock base from a first anchor and suspending the second end of the hammock base from a second anchor. Once suspended, the hammock base may be spread in the lateral direction using exclusively a dynamic spreader system. The dynamic spreader system may automatically adjust the amount of the spreading in response to changes in the weight, shape, or orientation of contents within the hammock base.|"BACKGROUND
1. The Field of the Invention
This invention relates to hammocks and, more particularly, to novel systems and methods for a dynamic hammock spreader providing the advantages of a rigid spreader without the instability associated therewith.
2. The Background Art
A hammock can typically be classified as one of two types or varieties. The first type of hammock is a hammock with one or more spreaders. The second type of hammock is a spreaderless hammock. Both types of hammocks have their strong points and weaknesses. For example, a hammock with a spreader is typically open, inviting, and non-confining. However, that hammock will typically be unstable. That is, if an occupant does not properly position himself over the center of the hammock, the hammock will roll, dumping the occupant on the ground.
Conversely, while spreaderless hammocks are quite stable, they have other problems. For example, without additional, external tethers, the material of a spreaderless hammock will tend to collect around an occupant. Many occupants find this cocooning effect to be undesirable.
In view of the foregoing, what is needed is a hammock providing the benefits of both spreader and spreaderless hammocks, without the liabilities and problems of either.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention as including a hammock comprising a hammock base and a hammock canopy. A hammock base may support the weight of a user occupying the hammock. A hammock canopy may extend over a hammock base and cooperate therewith in forming an enclosure. In certain embodiments, corresponding ends of the hammock base and hammock canopy may be gathered by first and second tethers. Accordingly, a hammock may converge to the respective tethers at each end.
Without any spreader, a hammock may tend to bunch together in the lateral direction. Such bunching may make it more difficult to enter a hammock. Thus, in selected embodiments, a hammock in accordance with the present invention may include a spreader system. In certain embodiments, a spreader system may be dynamic, varying or balancing the amount of spreading in the lateral direction imposed on the hammock.
Through the use of a dynamic spreader system, a hammock in accordance with the present invention may provide certain advantages associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders. However, due the dynamic nature of such a spreader system, a hammock in accordance with the present invention may avoid the instability associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders.
In selected embodiments, a dynamic spreader system may comprise one or more springs urging separation of the first and second sides of the hammock base. For example, in one embodiment, a dynamic spreader system may comprise one or more spreaders resiliently deflected to urge the first side of a hammock base away from the second side of the hammock base.
In certain embodiments, a spreader may comprise a flexible rod. A flexible rod may have a substantially linear neutral or non-deflected configuration. When resiliently bent, a flexible rod may arch over or under a hammock base. The ends of the flexible rod may be connected to respective sides of the hammock base. Accordingly, the tendency of the flexible rod to return to its substantially linear neutral configuration may urge the first side of the hammock base away from the second side of the hammock base. The flexible rod may be sized (e.g., in length, thickness, and the like) or configured such that the magnitude of this urging is insufficient to impart to the hammock base the instability associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders.
In embodiments where a spreader arches over a hammock base, the spreader may space a hammock canopy from a hammock base, increasing the volume of the enclosure therebetween. Loops, sleeves, hooks, or the like may be used to connect a spreader to a hammock canopy. The arch of the spreader may define or control the arch of the hammock canopy over the hammock base.
A dynamic spreader system in accordance with the present invention may automatically adjust the amount of spreading imposed on a hammock. In selected embodiments, this adjusting may be in response to changes in the weight, shape, orientation, and the like, or combinations thereof, of contents within the hammock base. Moreover, this adjusting may reflect or accommodate a new equilibrium between the forces generated by a dynamic spreader system and the forces associated with a hammock.
That is, a dynamic spreader system may increase the separation between the first and second sides of a hammock base until an equilibrium is reached between the forces generated by the dynamic spreader system and opposing forces associated with the weight of the hammock, its contents, etc. As the forces associated with the weight of the hammock, its contents, etc. change, the position of a dynamic spreader system at equilibrium therewith may vary.
In selected embodiments, a dynamic spreading system may be configured to provide (e.g., have a length and effective spring constant selected to provide) an optimal equilibrium when the corresponding hammock is occupied by a user. For example, a spreader may have a length and resiliency in bending such that the height of the arch formed by the spreader when the hammock base is occupied provides an optimal suspension and tensioning of the hammock canopy. This optimal suspension and tensioning may be characterized by a lack of unwanted sagging and a lack of excessive tension in the hammock canopy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS
It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the drawings herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention, as represented in the drawings, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of various embodiments of the invention. The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.
Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, in discussing a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention, it may be advantageous to establish a reliable coordinate system. Accordingly, a coordinate axes may be defined comprising longitudinal 11a, lateral 11b, and transverse directions 11c substantially orthogonal to one another.
A hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may include a hammock base 12 and a hammock canopy 14. A hammock base 12 may support the weight of a user occupying the hammock 10. A hammock canopy 14 may extend over a hammock base 12 and cooperate with the hammock base 12 in forming an enclosure. This enclosure may protect a user occupying the hammock 10 from insects, wind, rain, etc.
In selected embodiments, a hammock base 12 may be formed of flexible material such as a flexible fabric. A hammock base 12 may have a first end 16, a second end 18 opposite the first end 16 in the longitudinal direction 11a, a first side 20, and a second side 22 opposite the first side 20 in the lateral direction 11b. The material forming a hammock base 12 may have any suitable shape. In certain embodiments, the material forming a hammock base 12 may have a generally rectangular shape.
The first end 16 of a hammock base 12 may be folded to form a sleeve as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,772, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such a sleeve may be constructed to receive a first tether 24 (e.g., rope 24, strap 24, or the like) therethrough. The second end 18 of a hammock base 12 may be folded in like manner. Accordingly, the second end 18 may receive a second tether 26 (e.g., rope 26, strap 26, or the like) therethrough. The first and second ends 16, 18 may be respectively gathered and secured by the first and second tethers 24, 26. The first and second tethers 24, 26 may then extend from the hammock 10 to engage, or be suspended from, corresponding anchors (e,g., trees, posts, beams, hooks, etc.).
With each end 16, 18 pulled into a gather, the hammock base 12 may form a concavity. That is, gathering the first and second ends 16, 18 may cause the sides 20, 22 of the hammock base 12 to be pulled upwards in the transverse direction 11c, leaving a center portion 28 of the hammock base 12 to sag with slack therebetween and below. This concavity may form a comfortable, stable, and supportive space for a user to occupy.
A hammock canopy 14 in accordance with the present invention may be formed of flexible material such as a flexible fabric Like a hammock base 12, a hammock canopy may have a first end 30, a second end 32 opposite the first end 30 in the longitudinal direction 11a, a first side 34, and a second side 36 opposite the first side 34 in the lateral direction 11b. The material forming a hammock canopy 14 may have any suitable shape. In certain embodiments, the material forming a hammock canopy 14 may have a generally rectangular shape.
The first and second ends 30, 32 and first and second sides 34, 36 of a hammock canopy 14 may be respectively secured (e.g., sewn) to the first and second ends 16, 18 and first and second sides 20, 22 of a hammock base 12. In selected embodiments, the first end 30 of a hammock canopy 12 may be secured to the first end 16 of a hammock base 12 as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,772. The second end 32 of a hammock canopy 14 may be secured to the second end 18 of the hammock base 12 in like manner.
In certain embodiments, due to their respective securement to the first and second ends 16, 18, the first and second ends 30, 32 of the hammock canopy 14 may be gathered by the first and second tethers 24, 26. Accordingly, a hammock 10 may converge to the respective tethers 24, 26 at each end. Moreover, without any spreader, a hammock 10 may tend to bunch together in the lateral direction 11b. Such bunching may make it more difficult to enter a hammock 10. Thus, in selected embodiments, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may include a spreader system 38.
In selected embodiments, a spreader system 38 may be dynamic, varying or balancing the amount of spreading 40 in the lateral direction 11b imposed on the hammock 10. In such embodiments, the spreading 40 of a hammock 10 in the lateral direction 11b may be accomplished using exclusively a dynamic spreader system 38.
Through the use of a dynamic spreader system 38, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may provide certain advantages associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders. However, due the dynamic nature of such a spreader system 38, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may avoid the instability associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders.
A dynamic spreader system 38 in accordance with the present invention may take any suitable form. In selected embodiments, a dynamic spreader system 38 may comprise one or more springs urging separation of the first and second sides 20, 22 of the hammock base 12. For example, in one embodiment, a dynamic spreader system 38 may comprise one or more spreaders 42 resiliently deflected to urge the first side 20 of a hammock base 12 away from the second side 22 of the hammock base 12.
In selected embodiments, a spreader 42 may comprise a flexible rod 44. A flexible rod 44 may have a substantially linear neutral or non-deflected configuration. When resiliently bent, a flexible rod 44 may arch over or under a hammock base 12. The ends of the flexible rod 44 may be connected to respective sides 20, 22 of the hammock base 12. The tendency of the flexible rod 44 to return to its substantially linear neutral configuration may urge the first side 20 of the hammock base 12 away from the second side 22 of the hammock base 12. The flexible rod 44 may be sized or configured such that the magnitude of this urging is insufficient to impart to the hammock base 12 the instability associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders.
A flexible rod 44 in accordance with the present invention may be formed of any suitable material or materials and have any suitable configuration. In selected embodiments, a flexible rod 44 may comprise multiple rod segments connected via one or more couplers. By removing certain of such rod segments from corresponding couplers, each flexible rod 44 may be broken down for easier transport and storage. In one embodiment, solid, cylindrical, fiber glass rods of about one eighth inch (0.3 cm) to about quarter inch diameter (0.6 cm) may be suitable rod segments.
A spreader 42 in accordance with the present invention may be connected to a hammock 10 in any suitable manner. In selected embodiments, an extension strap 46 may extending from each side of a hammock 10 to engage respective ends of a spreader 42. Such extension straps 46 may secure to a hammock 10 in any suitable manner. For example, they may be sewn to the sides 20, 22 of the hammock base 10 or the sides 34, 36 of the hammock canopy 14. In one embodiment, extension straps 46 may be sewn into a seam joining a hammock base 12 to a hammock canopy 14.
Similarly, a spreader 42 in accordance with the present invention may be connected to an extension strap 46 in any suitable manner. In selected embodiments, an extension strap 46 may have a pocket formed therein. This pocket may receive and secure the end of a spreader 42 inserted therewithin. In other embodiments, an extension strap 46 may include a grommet. In such embodiments, an end of a spreader 42 may be configured to engage the grommet.
In embodiments where a spreader 42 arches over a hammock base 12, the spreader 42 may space a hammock canopy 14 from a hammock base 12, increasing the volume of the enclosure therebetween. In such embodiments, a spreader 42 may extend internally or externally with respect to a hammock canopy 14. Loops, sleeves 48, hooks, or the like may be used to connect a spreader 42 to a hammock canopy 42. For example, in one embodiment, one or more sleeves 48 may be secured to, or formed as part of, the hammock canopy 14. A spreader 42 may extend externally with respect to a hammock canopy 14, passing through the sleeves 48. The arch of the spreader 42 may define or control the arch of the hammock canopy 14 over the hammock base 12.
In selected embodiments, a spreader system 38 may include one or more spreaders 42. In one embodiment, a spreader system 38 may have only one spreader 42 positioned proximate the “head end” of a hammock base 12. In other embodiments, a spreader system 38 may have two spreaders 42. For example, one spreader 42 may be located proximate a first end 16 of a hammock base 12, while the other 42 may be positioned proximate a second end 18 of the hammock base 12. In such embodiments, a hammock 10 may have a generally cylindrical mid-section with conical ends gathered to converge to respective tethers 24, 26.
In certain embodiments, a hammock canopy 14 may have a door 50 or entryway 50 formed therein. For example, a hammock canopy 14 may include a portion of material that is connected, at least partially, to the rest of the hammock canopy 14 via a zipper. By operating the zipper, a user may create an opening into the enclosure formed by the hammock base 12 and hammock canopy 14.
An entryway 50 in a hammock canopy 14 may have multiple layers. For example, an entryway 50 may include a screen or mesh layer 52 providing both ventilation and a barrier to insects. An entryway 50 may also include a wind break layer resisting air flow through the entryway 50 Accordingly, when the wind break layer is closed (e.g., zipped closed), an occupant of the hammock 10 may be protected from excessive exchange with the outside air. Such a configuration may be desirable in windy or cold conditions.
The perimeter of an entryway 50 in accordance with the present invention may have any suitable shape or configuration. In one embodiment having two spreaders 42, the perimeter (e.g., zipper) of an entryway 50 may encircle or encompass substantially the entire portion of the hammock canopy 14 between the first and second sides 34, 36 and the two spreaders 42.
In selected embodiments, a hammock 10 may include storage pockets 54. The preferably large pockets 54 may be placed underneath the hammock base 12. The pockets 54 may provide space for storing gear, food, and supplies off the ground and within easy reach of an occupant of the hammock 10. The pockets 54 may also provide a dead air space on the underside of the hammock base 12. The dead air space may slow heat flow from the occupant out through the underside of the hammock base 12. In other embodiments, the pockets 54 may be omitted or under-quilting may be substituted in the place of the pocket 54.
A dynamic spreader system 38 in accordance with the present invention may automatically adjust the amount of spreading 40 imposed on a hammock 10. In selected embodiments, this adjusting may be in response to changes in the weight, shape, orientation, and the like, or combinations thereof, of contents within the hammock base 12. Moreover, this adjusting may reflect or accommodate a new equilibrium between the forces generated by a dynamic spreader system 38 and the forces associated with a hammock 10.
That is, a dynamic spreader system 38 may urge separation of the first and second sides 20, 22 of a hammock base 12. However, this separation may not occur in isolation. Movement of the first and second sides 20, 22 of a hammock base 12 away from each other in the lateral direction 11b may induce other, corresponding movements.
For example, lateral separation may draw the center portion 28 of the hammock base 12 upward in the transverse direction 11c. Additionally, lateral separation may draw the first and second ends 16, 18 of the hammock base 12 closer together in the longitudinal direction 11a. This latter motion may reduce the slack with which the hammock 10 hangs between corresponding anchors and effectively raise the elevation of the entire hammock 10.
Accordingly, a dynamic spreader system 38 may increase the separation between the first and second sides 20, 22 of a hammock base 12 until an equilibrium is reached between the forces generated by the dynamic spreader system 38 and opposing forces associated with the weight of the hammock 10, its contents, etc. As the forces associated with the weight of the hammock 10, its contents, etc. change, the position of a dynamic spreader system 38 at equilibrium therewith may vary.
For example, in an empty or lightly weighted hammock 10 (e.g., the hammock of FIGS. 1 and 2), there may be little weight urging the central portion 28 of a hammock base 10 downward. In such situations, the forces opposing a dynamic spreading system 38 may be at a minimum. Accordingly, the amount of spreading 40 imposed by the dynamic spreading system 38 may be at a maximum.
Conversely, in a loaded or occupied hammock 10 (e.g., the hammock of FIGS. 3 and 4), there may be significant weight urging the central portion 28 of a hammock base 10 downward. In such situations, the forces opposing a dynamic spreading system 38 may be substantial. Accordingly, the amount of spreading 40 imposed by the dynamic spreading system 38 may be reduced.
Shape, orientation, and the like of contents within a hammock 10 may also influence the amount of spreading 40 imposed by the dynamic spreading system 38. For example, an object may have a length greater than its width. When the object is placed within a hammock base 12 such that the length of the object aligns with the longitudinal direction 11a, a first equilibrium may be reached between the forces associated with the object and those of the dynamic spreader system 38. When the object is placed within a hammock base 12 such that the length of the object aligns with the lateral direction 11b, a second equilibrium may be reached between the forces associated with the object and those of the dynamic spreader system 38. In such an example, the object weighs the same in both orientations. However, the spreading 40 associated with the second equilibrium may be greater than the spreading 40 associated with the first equilibrium.
In selected embodiments, a dynamic spreading system 38 in accordance with the present invention may be configured to provide (e.g., have a length and effective spring constant selected to provide) an optimal equilibrium when the corresponding hammock 10 is occupied by a user. That is, like a tent, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may appear to its greatest advantage when it is pitched or set up tightly with a minimum of sagging material. Accordingly, the amount of spreading 40 provided by, and the overall configuration of, a dynamic spreader system 38 at equilibrium with an occupied hammock 10 may coincide with and support an optimally deployed configuration of the occupied hammock 10.
For example, in selected embodiments, a dynamic spreader system 38 may comprise a spreader 42 arching over a hammock base 12. In such embodiments, changes in the amount of spreading 40 may correspond to changes in the grade (i.e., degree of incline) and overall height of the arch formed by the spreader 42. In general, the greater the amount of spreading 40, the less the grade and the overall height of the arch and vice versa.
In certain embodiments, changes in the overall height of an arch formed by a spreader 42 may affect a hammock canopy 14 supported by the spreader 42. For example, the height of an arch may affect the amount of separation between a hammock canopy 12 and a hammock base 14. The height on an arch may also affect the amount of sag within a hammock canopy 14. Too little height my cause the hammock canopy 14 to sag excessively, causing unwanted encroachment into the space of an occupant of the hammock base 12. Too much height may cause a hammock canopy 14 to be pulled excessively tight, causing unwanted wear on seams, zippers of an entryway 50, etc.
Accordingly, in selected embodiments, a spreader 42 may have a length and resiliency in bending such that the height of the arch formed by the spreader 42 when the hammock base 12 is occupied provides an optimal suspension and tensioning of the hammock canopy 14. This optimal suspension and tensioning may be characterized by a lack of unwanted sagging and a lack of excessive tension in the hammock canopy 14.
Due to the dynamic nature of the spreading 40 imposed by a dynamic spreader system 38 in accordance with the present invention, a spreader 42 optimized for an occupied hammock base 12 may not be optimized for that hammock 10 when the hammock base 12 is unoccupied and substantially unweighted. However, it has been found that the shape or configuration of such a hammock 10 when unoccupied and substantially unweighted is suitable for its intended purpose.
This concept of an optimized spreader 42 may become more evident when comparing FIG. 1 to FIG. 3. The hammock 10 illustrated in these two figures is the same. The only difference is that in FIG. 1, the hammock 10 is unoccupied and substantially unweighted by contents, while in FIG. 3, the hammock 10 is occupied by a user. The spreaders 42 applied to the hammock 10 in these figures are optimized for the occupied configuration (i.e., the configuration show in FIG. 3).
As can be seen, in FIG. 3, the entryway portion 50 of the hammock canopy 14 is ideally tensioned. The occupant in hammock 10 would not feel that the hammock canopy 14 is sagging and encroaching on him. In contrast, in FIG. 1, the entryway portion 50 of the hammock canopy 14 sags into the interior of the enclosure formed by the hammock 10. However, in the unoccupied and substantially unweighted configuration of FIG. 1, there is by definition no occupant being encroached by such sagging. Moreover, the amount of spreading 40 imposed and the suspension of the hammock canopy 14 is sufficient to fully expose the entryway 50 to view so that it may easily be opened or closed.
In selected embodiments, the amount of sag in a hammock canopy 14 may be used as an indicator of proper hammock 10 installation. That is, when suspending a hammock 10 between anchors, an installer may refer to the amount of sag in a hammock canopy 14 rather than resorting to a trial and error method requiring repeated entering and exiting of the hammock 10.
In such a method in accordance with the present invention, an installer may suspend a hammock 10 between two anchors, then install one or more spreaders 42. Once the spreaders 42 are installed, the installer may view the sag in the hammock canopy 14. If the sag is excessive, the installer may shorten the tethers 24, 26 suspending the hammock 10. This may raise the hammock 110 and reduce the sag in the hammock canopy 14. If the sag is too little, the installer may lengthen the tethers 24, 26 suspending the hammock 10. This may lower the hammock 110 and increase the sag in the hammock canopy 14.
Once the sag of the hammock canopy 14 is at the appropriate level, the installer may be assured that when occupied, the dynamic spreading system 38 will impose just the right spread 40 (and corresponding arch height) to optimally tension the hammock canopy 14 once the hammock 10 is weighted or occupied. In selected embodiments, the sag of the hammock canopy 14 in FIG. 1 may be this appropriate level. In such embodiments, the sag may be about one half the maximum height of the hammock canopy 14 above a corresponding hammock base 12.
Referring to FIG. 5, in selected embodiments, a hammock 10 may include one or more pockets 56 for receiving and storing the door 50 or entryway 50 portion of the hammock canopy 14 when it is not in use. Such pockets 56 may include openings 58 into which the door 50 or entryway 50 may be tucked.
In certain embodiments, a portion of a hammock canopy 14 may include two pockets 56. Each pocket 56 may have an opening 58 corresponding thereto. One such pocket 56 may be configured to receive and store the wind-break layer of the entryway 50 when it is not in use. The other such pocket may be configured to receive and store the netting 52 layer of the entryway 50 when it is not in use.
A hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may provide certain advantages associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders. However, due the dynamic nature of such a spreader system 38, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may avoid the instability associated with hammocks having rigid spreaders.
For example, hammocks having rigid spreaders are held open and are therefore relatively easy to enter. Also, due to their open nature, hammocks having rigid spreaders may seem non-confining, inviting, and comfortable. However, these advantages come at a cost. Hammocks having rigid spreaders are inherently unstable. If the weight carried by a hammocks having rigid spreaders is insufficiently centered with respect to those spreaders, that weight will be dumped from the hammock. In contrast, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may provide an open, inviting, non-confining environment that is both easy to enter and stable.
An occupant may be eccentrically positioned with respect to a hammock base 12 and a dynamic spreader system 38 without destabilizing a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention. In the past, such stability was the exclusive domain of spreaderless hammocks. However, unlike in typical spreaderless hammocks, an occupant of a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention is not enveloped or cocooned in material. Rather, the occupant may enjoy a rather spacious and open environment in which the unoccupied portion 60 of the hammock base 12 is held up and away from the occupant.
Referring to FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C, in selected embodiments, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may align its center of mass with a vertical plane 62 containing the tethers 24, 26 extending from opposite ends of the hammock 10. As contents are added to such a hammock 10, the combined center of mass of the contents and the hammock 10 may also align with the same vertical plane 62.
Due to the large difference between the mass of an occupant 64 and the mass of the hammock 10, the center of mass of the occupant 64 may largely define the center of mass of the hammock 10 and occupant 64 system. Accordingly, as an occupant 64 moves within the hammock base 12, he or she may not leave the vertical plane 62. The hammock 10, on the other hand, may effectively rotate around or about the occupant 64.
For example, as an occupant moves (e.g., rolls) toward the second side 22 of the hammock base 12, the hammock 10 may effectively rotate in a first direction about the occupant 64. Conversely, as an occupant moves toward the first side 20 of the hammock base 12, the hammock 10 may effectively rotate in a second direction 68, opposite the first direction 66, about the occupant 64.
As an occupant 64 moves through the range of motion supported by the hammock base 12, from one extreme (e.g., the position shown in FIG. 6A) to the other (e.g., the position shown in FIG. 6C), the occupant 64 may enjoy at all times an open area thereabove. Accordingly, a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may provide an open, inviting, non-confining environment.
Similarly, as an occupant 64 moves through the range of motion supported by the hammock base 12, the occupant 64 may enjoy at all times a stable platform. That is, at no point in the range of motion supported by the hammock base 12 is the occupant 64 pushed or urged toward further motion. The occupant 64 may reside just as stably in an extreme of the range of motion as the occupant 64 can in the center of the range of motion.
In selected embodiments, the stability of a hammock 10 in accordance with the present invention may arise at least in part by the inability of the dynamic spreader system 38 to laterally flatten the hammock base 12. A dynamic spreader system 38 may urge separation of the first and second sides 20, 22 of the hammock base 12 in the lateral direction 11b. However, a dynamic spreader system 38 may not have unlimited strength or force to urge that separation. In certain embodiments, a spreader 42 of a dynamic spreader system 38 may be configured (e.g., sized) with insufficient strength or force to laterally flatten an unweighted hammock base 12, let alone an occupied one.
That is, one may imagine a line 70 extending laterally from one side 20 of a hammock base 12 to the other 22. In selected embodiments, this line 70 may pass through the locations where the extension straps 46 secure to the hammock 10. Accordingly, the line 70 may approximate a line at which a spreader 42 applies its spreading force to a hammock base 12.
The distance 72 between this imaginary line 70 and the bottom of the hammock base 12 may reflect the ratio between the spreading force of a spreader 42 and the weight of a hammock 10 and its contents. The greater the spreading force of a spreader 42 in comparison to the weight of a hammock 10 and its contents, the less the distance 72. Conversely, the lower the spreading force of a spreader 42 in comparison to the weight of a hammock 10 and its contents, the greater the distance 72.
If a dynamic spreader system 38 in accordance with the present invention were removed and replaced by a typical rigid spreader in the typical manner, then the distance 72 between the imaginary line 70 and the bottom of the hammock base 12 would be minimal. Accordingly, there would be no sagging pocket in the hammock base 12 to support an occupant 64. There would be no inherent stability. Once movement of an occupant 64 induced excessive rotation 66, 68, there would be nothing to stop it, with the result being the dumping of the occupant 64 from the hammock base 12.
Accordingly, to overcome the problems associated with rigid spreaders, a spreader 42 of a dynamic spreader system 38 in accordance with the present invention may be configured with insufficient strength or force to laterally flatten an occupied hammock 10. By so doing, the hammock base 12 may provide stable support for an occupant 64 in the extreme positions illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6C.
Referring to FIG. 7, a dynamic spreader system 38 in accordance with the present invention may support a wide range of spreading 40. The amount of spreading 40 imposed may depend on various factors as discussed hereinabove. In selected embodiments, the greatest spreading 40 may correspond to an unoccupied or substantially unweighted hammock 10. The minimum spreading 40 may be about zero. That is, the first and second sides 20, 22 of a hammock base 12 may be drawn substantially together without failing the dynamic spreader system 38.
In actual use, the minimum spreading 40 may correspond to a hammock base 12 being used as a seat or chair, with the occupant 64 oriented orthogonally with respect to the longitudinal direction 11a. When used in that manner, a large portion of the lateral width of the hammock base 12 may be loaded by the weight of the occupant 64. Accordingly, substantially all of the hammock base 12 may be tensioned in the longitudinal direction 11a. 
Due to the configuration of the spreaders 42, the dynamic spreader system 38 may have insufficient strength or force to laterally spread such a tensioned hammock base 12. Accordingly, the spreaders 42 may simply adapt to or reflect the amount of spreading 40 between the first and second sides 20, 22 of the hammock base 12 imposed by the particular use.
Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, in selected embodiments, a spreader 42 in accordance with the present invention may be biased toward a vertical orientation. For example, the arch formed by a spreader 42 when it is deflected over a hammock base 12 may be biased toward a vertical position. So configured, a spreader 42 may maintain a substantially vertical orientation, even when the entryway 50 in the hammock canopy 14 is open.
That is, when a spreader 42 is in a vertical position and the entryway 50 of the hammock canopy 14 is open, material forming the hammock canopy 14 may resist leaning 72 of the arch toward the longitudinal center of the hammock 10. However, when the entryway 50 in the hammock canopy 14 is open, no portion of the hammock canopy 14 may be available to resist leaning 74 of the arch toward the other side (i.e., away from the longitudinal center of the hammock 10). In such situations, the bias of the spreader 42 may be sufficient to maintain the spreader 42 in the vertical position.
In selected embodiments, the bias of a spreader 42 toward the vertical position may arise due to the lower energy associated with that position. For example, as the arch of a spreader 42 is pushed 74 away from the longitudinal center of the hammock 10, the material of the hammock canopy 14 (e.g., the sleeves 48, contour or perimeter shape of the entryway 50, etc.) may act in concert with the extension straps 46 to increase the load or deflection applied to the spreader 42. In certain embodiments, this increased load or deflection may cause the ends of the spreader 42 to deflect 76 closer in toward the hammock base 12. Due to the increase in the load or deflection applied to a spreader 42 in a non-vertical position, the spreader 42 may urge (e.g., with an equal and opposite force) a return to the vertical position.
Referring to FIG. 10, in certain embodiments, it may be desirable to adjust the length of a tether 24, 26 suspending a hammock 10. This may be done by untying then retying a tether 24, 26, pulling a tether 24, 26 through an adjustment buckle, or the like. Additionally, in selected embodiments in accordance with the present invention, a drip ring adjustment method may be used to adjust the length of a tether 24, 26.
A drip ring 78 may prevent water from running down a tether 24, 26 and wetting a hammock 10. In an installed configuration, a tether 24, 26 may pass through the interior aperture 80 of the drip ring 78 in a first direction 82, wrap around one side of the ring 78, then again pass through the interior aperture 80 in the first direction 82. When the tether 24, 26 is tensioned (e.g., the hammock 10 is weighted), the drip ring 78 may be held securely in place. Due to this securement, the drip ring 78 may provide a location to which a free end 84 of the tether 24, 26 may secure.
That is, the free end 84 of a tether 24, 26 may extend away from a hammock 10, engage an anchor, then return back along itself. As it returns along itself, the free end 84 may engage or be tied to the drip ring 78, thus defining the effective length of the tether 24, 26. In such embodiments, the effective length of the tether 24, 26 may be adjusted by moving the drip ring 78 toward or away from the hammock 10.
This may be accomplished by first removing the tension in the tether 24, 26 (e.g., removing objects of significant weight from the hammock 10). Material forming the tether 24, 26 may then be inserted 86 though the aperture 80 in the drip ring 78 to enlarge and loosen the loop 88 wrapped around the side of the drip ring 78. With the loop 88 enlarged and loose, the drip ring 78 may advance or retreat along the tether 24, 26 until the desired new effective length is reached. When the desired effective length for the tether 24, 26 is reached, the loop 88 may be pulled tight against the drip ring 78, thereby locking it in place.
The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope."

This application is a nonprovisional utility application of provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/280,119, filed in the United States Patent Office on Oct. 31, 2009 and claims the prior thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates generally to a crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat and a method of construction thereof. More particularly, the invention relates to a crushable, lightweight high-fashion hat made from a plurality of lightweight, breathable and blockable materials that is constructed by a method of layering and cutting the materials and stitching the layers in a manner that maintains the shape of the hat and helps restore the shape after crushing.
Although relaxed fit hats, such as caps and berets are perennial fashion favorites, fashion trends have revived an interest in hats with a more formal, finished look with a defined shape and structure. Customarily, these types of hats were made from traditional materials such as felt or straw. Manufacturing places natural stresses on fabrics that may result in deviations from its intended shape and size. To form hats into a defined shape and structure, milliners used a process called blocking. Through heat and moisture, blocking sets the stitches and standardizes the final dimensions, and may enhance the drape and folds of the materials. Blocking gives a hat its shape and style.
Blocking is a deceptively easy process that can either create beautiful headwear or ruin the piece. First, steam or heat is applied to the hat either from the inside or outside. The hat is placed on the block, which is typically head-shaped. A flange is used for brims after the head blocking is complete. The block is typically wood although other new plastic materials are also being used. The hat is steamed from the inside or outside, either before placement on the block or immediately after. The milliner or hat maker shapes the hat by hand into the desired style and shape by alternatively applying pressure and heat. Once the hat is in the desired shape, it is allowed to dry, removed from the block, and allowed to further dry.
Generally blocked hats made from traditional materials require considerable maintenance. They must be stored in hatboxes or other containers that take up considerable space to avoid crushing or collapsing while traveling or storing. Traditional blocked hats must be dry-cleaned and protected from the rain and excessive moisture. In most cases, the hats are sized or stiffened to add support; however, the sizing agents are water-soluble, thus causing the materials to lose their shape-retaining properties when wet. Failure to properly maintain and store blocked hats often results in a shapeless, ruined head covering.
Relaxed-fit hats eliminate the maintenance challenges of blocked hats. They are generally made from a much wider variety of fabrics without being restricted to felt and straw and use an interfacing of a variety of materials, including foam. They are often washable, pliable, lightweight and breathable, admitting air to the skin and allowing sweat to evaporate. However, they are limited to casual wear such as sports hats, berets, and caps because they cannot be blocked to hold a particular shape. As a result, the high fashion appearance of a blocked hat cannot be achieved with the materials and techniques used to manufacture relaxed-fit hats. A blockable high fashion hat that is also pliable, washable, stylish, comfortable, lightweight, breathable, collapsable and maintains or can be easily restored to its original shape is highly paradoxical using current methods and materials of hat construction.
While these units may be suitable for the particular purpose employed, or for general use, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention as disclosed hereafter.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the invention to produce a crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat that is breathable. Accordingly, the crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat is constructed with breathable materials, such as open-cell foam, open-mesh material and woven fabric in a plurality of layers forming a lamination, that is porous, admitting air to the skin and scalp and allowing sweat to evaporate.
It is a further object of the invention to produce a crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat that is high fashion, using styles that require traditional blocking and fabrics that traditionally did not respond to the blocking process. Accordingly, the crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat is constructed from open-cell foam and woven materials, such as high fashion fabrics, sandwiched in a lamination that is blockable in a traditional manner.
It is another object of the invention to produce a crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat that maintains its shape or is easily restored to its original shape. Accordingly, the crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat is topstitched with a stitching pattern that creates sacs in the lamination that form an air bubble matrix structure when blocked, that after crushing the hat expelling the air out, refills with air to reform the matrix structure and original shape.
The invention is a high fashion, crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat using a method of construction that produces a blockable, washable, stylish, comfortable, pliable, breathable hat, that maintains its original shape or can be easily restored to its original shape. The hat employs an open-cell foam material and a plurality of woven materials in a lamination, all materials being breathable and lightweight and as well as a method of construction that is versatile and usable for countless variations is style. The lamination is blockable even when fabrics that are not traditionally blockable are used. A stitching pattern of topstitching forms a plurality of sacs that maintain the original shape of the hat after blocking by creating an air bubble matrix structure that refills after crushing. Optional trim elements are constructed from the lamination using the stitching pattern to create a wide variety of high fashion hats styles with flat or peaked crowns.
To the accomplishment of the above and related objects the invention may be embodied in the form illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Attention is called to the fact, however, that the drawings are illustrative only. Variations are contemplated as being part of the invention, limited only by the scope of the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
FIG. 3 illustrates a high fashion, crushable, lightweight, collapsible hat 10A using a method of construction that produces a blockable, washable, stylish, comfortable, pliable, breathable hat 10A that maintains its original shape or can be easily restored to its original shape. The hat 10A employs an open-cell foam material and a plurality of woven materials, all materials being breathable, and lightweight, as well as a method of construction that is versatile and usable for countless variations is style. Breathable materials admit air to the skin and scalp, allowing sweat to evaporate. The illustrated hat 10A has a plurality of elements such as a flat crown 20, a brim 30 and at least one band 40. The hat 10A has a stitching pattern 60 of topstitching to create a plurality of rows 62 and a plurality of layers of breathable, lightweight, materials in a lamination 50 that is blockable, that is, responding to heat and steam during the blocking process, producing the crushable, blockable hat construction. The lamination 50 is blockable even when fabrics that are not traditionally blockable are used. The stitching pattern 60 forms a plurality of sacs that maintain the original shape of the hat 10A after blocking.
In this discussion, the term blocking is for the process of steaming or applying heat to a hat either from the inside or outside, placing the hat on a head-shaped block, or placing the brim of the hat on a flange after the head blocking is complete, steaming from the inside or outside, shaping the hat into the desired style and shape by alternatively applying pressure and heat, and removing from the block to dry.
The lamination 50 is formed by sandwiching with a plurality of open-cell foam layers 52 having a pair of plane surfaces, having at least one layer of foam 52 between a pair of surface layers of woven fabric 58 by adhering the foam layer 52 to the fabric layers 58 with a plurality of adhesive layers 54. In other embodiments, an open-mesh layer 56 and, optionally, an additional layer of foam 52, are sandwiched in between the fabric layers by more adhesive layers 54. The grain of all woven materials, such as the fabric layer 58 and the open-mesh layer 56 are aligned before forming the lamination 50. The lamination has an inner surface fabric layer 58N and an outer surface fabric layer 58X. The inner surface fabric 58N is selected from breathable, lightweight and steam-compatible lining fabric and the outer surface layer fabric 58X is selected on high fashion appearance, breathability, lightness in weight, and compatibility with steam heat. The outer surface layer of fabric 58X includes and is not limited to felt and straw but also includes traditionally non-blockable high fashion fabrics such as silk, nylon, polyester, blends, metallics or other lightweight, breathable fabrics compatible with steam heat. These lightweight, breathable, steam-compatible fabrics desired for high fashion hats are too numerous for this discussion and are well-known to those of ordinary skill and beyond the scope of this discussion.
FIG. 3 shows, in a cutaway section, the plurality of layers of materials forming the lamination 50 to produce the blockable construction. In FIG. 3, the outer surface fabric layer 58X is adhered to the adhesive layer 54 to the foam layer 52. The foam layer 52 is adhered to the open-mesh layer 56 by a second adhesive layer 54. The open-mesh layer 56 is adhered to the second foam layer 52 by a third adhesive layer 54. The second foam layer 52 is adhered to the inner surface fabric layer 58N by a fourth adhesive layer 54.
FIG. 1 shows another high fashion hat 10B with a plurality of bands 40, and a trim element 42. The hat 10B is constructed from the lamination described hereinabove. The crown 20, the brim 30, the bands 40 and the trim element 42 are cut from the lamination into a plurality of panels. The stitching pattern 60 is sewn on the bands 40, the crown 20, the brim 30, and the trim element 42. The crown 20 is flat and annular with a center 20C and a circumferential edge 20E. In FIG. 1, the crown 20 has a spiral stitching pattern 60S, forming a plurality of rows 62 of topstitching, starting at the center 20C and spiraling outward to the circumferential edge 20E. In another embodiment the crown 20 is ovoid with a long axis, short axis and a center point at the intersection of the axes. The spiral stitching pattern for the ovoid crown starting at the center and spiraling outward in the ovoid shape of the crown to form the rows of topstitching. When the crown is ovoid, the straight-of-grain line of the woven materials is aligned with the long axis.
In FIG. 1, the plurality of bands 40 have a top edge 40T and a bottom edge 40B. The top edge 40T of a first band 40 is attached to the circumferential edge 20E of the crown. The top edge 40T of a second band 40 is attached to the bottom edge 40B of the first band 40. Additional bands are optionally attached according to the fashion design. The brim 30 has a top edge 30T and a bottom edge 30B. The top edge 30T of the brim 30 attaches to the bottom edge 40B of the last band 40 added.
FIG. 6 shows the spiral stitching pattern 60S for the crown 20. The spiral stitching pattern 60S is easily executed using a sewing machine because the needle does not require repositioning, but stitches continuously from the center to the edge, creating the plurality of rows 62 of topstitches. There is a space 64 between each row 62 that is approximately the same width throughout the spiral stitching pattern 60S. Between the spiral stitching, in the space 64, the sac in the lamination is formed. FIG. 7 shows a further embodiment with a concentric stitching pattern 60C on the crown 20. Each row 62 of the top stitching is a discrete circle, all having the same center 20C. The space 64 between each row 62 is approximately the same width through the concentric stitching pattern 60C. Between the concentric stitching, in the space 64, the sac of the lamination formed.
FIG. 4A shows the lamination 50 of the foam layer 52 adhered to the pair of fabric layers 58. The adhesive layers 54 are sprayed on, or are fusible interfacings that adhere two materials by fusing the materials to the interfacing with heat. The foam layer 52 is an open-cell foam thin sheet, of a polymeric material, such as, for example, but not limited to, foam rubber, EVA or polyurethane. The foam sheet has a thickness of approximately one-eight to one-fourth inch. It is understood by those of ordinary skill that the dimensions are provided for illustrative purposes and that variations in thickness of the foam sheet are possible within the inventive concept.
FIG. 4B shows the lamination 50 having the foam layer 52 adhered to the open-mesh layer 56 by the adhesive layer 54, forming a composite center layer, the center layer sandwiched between the pair of adhesive layers 54 attaching the pair of fabric layers 58. The open-mesh layer 56 is a slightly stiff, blockable, loosely woven fabric that has a large number of closely spaced holes, such as, for example, but not limited to, organdy, tulle, nylon, gauze, or horsehair.
FIG. 4C shows the lamination 50 having the open-mesh layer 56 sandwiched by a pair of foam layers 52 adhered to the open-mesh layer 56 by a pair of adhesive layers 54, forming a center composite layer, the center composite layer sandwiched between a pair of adhesive layers 54 attaching the pair of fabric layers 58. Other variations of the lamination using at least one open-cell foam layer and optionally the open-mesh layer adhering to the surface fabric layers by the plurality of adhesive layers are possible within the inventive concept. It is understood by those of ordinary skill that the composition of the lamination varies depending on the size, style and shape desired in the particular hat, while maintaining the lightweight, breathable, crushable characteristics of the invention.
FIG. 5 demonstrates the sac 66 formed between the rows 62 of topstitches in the stitching patterns of the invention. A pair of topstitches 74 form the sac 66, one on each side of the sac. The stitches 74 are in the spiral or the concentric stitching pattern as described hereinabove or in parallel or coil-shaped stitching pattern as described hereinbelow. Between the topstitches, as illustrated, the lamination 50 has the center open-mesh layer 56 sandwiched by the pair of foam layers 52 adhered to the open mesh layer 56 by the pair of adhesive layers 54, forming a center composite layer, the center composite layer sandwiched between the pair of adhesive layers 54 attaching the pair of fabric surface layers 58. The foam layers 52 are open-cell foam, having an internal structure with a plurality of tiny air bubbles that are interconnected to form a complex matrix structure. During blocking using heat and steam, the foam layers form a new internal structure within the foam that is held firmly in place by the stitches 74. The new internal structure has elastic memory. When crushed, air leaves the open cell structure and when it is relaxed air returns to the open cell structure, returning the foam layers 52 to the original blocked shape. The optional open-mesh layer 56 provides additional support in the lamination 50 and allows air to enter and leave the foam layers 52.
Referring to FIG. 1, the illustrated high fashion hat 10b has a parallel stitching pattern 60P on the bands 40 and the brim 30 forming a plurality of rows 62 of stitching and the plurality of sacs in the spaces 64 between. The spaces 64 between each row 62 is approximately the same width throughout the parallel stitching pattern 60P. The parallel stitching pattern 60P is sewn onto the band 40 or the brim 30 after an oblong panel of lamination has been sewn into a closed circle to form the band or brim.
FIG. 2 shows the inside of two bands 40 to illustrate. The band 40 is made from the lamination 50 of materials and has a pair of long edges 40L and a pair of short edges 40S. The short edges 40S are initially sewn together with the outside fabric layer 58X having a plain seam, the plain seam having a pair of raw edges toward the inside fabric layer 58N. The pair of raw edges are sewn into a flat-felled seam 72 such as a French seam to hide the raw edges with a clean finish and present a flat inside fabric layer. The parallel stitching pattern 60P is sewn onto the band as a topstitch, sewing over the flat-felled seam 72. Each band 40 and brim 20 is prepared with the parallel stitching pattern 60P prior to assembling the finished hat. The long edge 40L of a first band 40 is sewed to the long edge 40L of a second band with a simple seam, having the pair of raw edges 42 on the inside fabric layer 58N. The raw edges are later trimmed and bound by covering with a fabric tape to finish the seam. The long edge 40L of the band 40 near the crown is sewn to the circumferential edge of the crown and the seam is bound. The long edge of the band near the brim is sewn to the long edge of the brim and the seam is bound. The trim element is prepared in a similar manner by sewing the lamination into the desired shape, topstitching in the stitching pattern appropriate to the piece onto the trim element and attaching the trim element to the hat.
Referring to FIG. 3, the illustrated hat 10A has a coil-shaped stitching pattern 60CL on the band 40 and brim 30. The short edges of the band are joined in the finished seam 72 as described hereinabove. Topstitching starts any place on the long edge, but preferably at the finished short edge seam 72. The stitching circumnavigates around the band forming a coil-shaped stitching pattern 60CL of rows. The coil-shaped stitching pattern 60CL is easily executed using a sewing machine because the needle does not require repositioning, but stitches continuously from a first long edge to a second long edge, creating a plurality of rows 62 of topstitches. There is a space 64 between each row 62 that is approximately the same width throughout the coil-shaped stitching pattern, forming the sacs. The concentricity of the coil-shaped topstitching in this embodiment, as well as the parallel stitching pattern described in the embodiment hereinabove, allows the hat to collapse on itself without significant wrinkling of the fabric layers. Additionally, pressure from the foam layer adhered to the fabric layer prevents the significant wrinkling of the fabric layer. If minor wrinkling occurs, the open-cell foam aids in refreshing the fabric by channelling steam through the hat to the fabric layers.
FIG. 3 also shows an optional wire 92 at the long edge 30L of the brim 30. The wire 92 is resilient and supple, returning to its original shape when bent, lending additional support to the brim 30. The wire 92 is stitched to the raw edge before finishing the edge with fabric tape. Optionally, a second wire is stitched inside the hat between the pair of raw edges at the seam of the circumferential edge 20E of the crown 20 and the band 40 before finishing the edge with fabric tape.
FIG. 8 shows another embodiment of the invention as illustrated by the high fashion hat that has a peaked crown 22. The peaked crown hat is constructed with the lamination. In the illustration, the peaked crown 22 is on a block 90 used in the blocking process. The peaked crown 22 is formed by a plurality of wedge-shaped panels 12, each panel 12 having a perimeter with a plurality of long edges 12E, a top narrow end 12T and a bottom wide end 12B. Each panel has the lamination, wherein a plurality of straight-of-grain lines of the woven materials are aligned. Woven materials have a grain 80 which is a longitudinal arrangement of fiber in the material. The panel is “cut on the bias,” that is, the grain 80 of the material is at a forty-five degree angle to the cut long edges 12E of the panel 12.
Each panel 12 has the long edges 12E and attaches to an adjoining panel 12 by a seam 76 from the top 12T of the long edge to the bottom 12B, with the narrow ends 12T of the panels 12 joining at a peak 24 of the crown.
FIG. 9 shows the inside of the peaked crown 22 showing the seams 76 attaching a first panel 12 to a second panel 12. The seams 76 are simple seams with the raw edges 42 trimmed, pressed open and flat or optionally covered by fabric tape. The cut away section illustrates the layers of the lamination 50, showing the center open-mesh layer 56 sandwiched by the pair of foam layers 52 adhered to the open-mesh layer 56 by a pair of adhesive layers 54, forming a center composite layer, the center composite layer sandwiched between a pair of adhesive layers 54 attaching a pair of fabric surface layers 58N, 58×. The pressure of the foam layer 52 adhered to the fabric layer 58 maintains the shape and prevents significant wrinkling of the fabric layer 58 in this embodiment using the structure of the panels 12 without requiring topstitching.
Referring to FIG. 3, the method of construction of the lightweight, crushable hat 10A with a flat crown 20 starts with aligning all layers of woven materials in the lamination 50, such as the fabric layers 58X, 58N and the optional open-mesh layer 56. The flat crown 20 is cut in a circle or optionally an oval, which is cut on the bias, with straight-of-grain 80 lines of the woven material aligned at an angle with the long axis of the oval. Concentric or spiral stitching patterns 60 are topstitched onto the cut lamination. The band 40 and brim 39 are cut and the short edges are sewn into the flat-felled seam 72. Parallel or coil-shaped stitching patterns 60CL are topstitched onto the closed-circle band 40 or brim 30. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the top edge 40T of the first band 40 is attached to the circumferential edge 20E of the crown 20 by a simple seam. The bottom long edge 40B of the band 40 is sewn by a simple seam to the top edge of the brim 30T or the top edge 40T of the optional second band 40. Additional bands are added in this manner according to the style of the hat. The raw edges of the simple seams and the bottom edge of the brim are bound and finished with fabric tape. An optional wire is added to the edge of the crown or the edge of the brim before binding. The hat is blocked into the desired shape. The optional trim elements constructed from the lamination, topstitched with the stitching pattern, are added after blocking.
Referring to FIG. 8, the method of construction of the lightweight, crushable hat with a peaked crown 22 starts with aligning the straight-of-grain lines 80 of the woven materials in the lamination, such as the fabric layers and the optional open-mesh layer. Cutting the panels 12 into the wedge shape on the bias, sewing the panels 12 together at the long edges 12E with the narrow ends 12T of the panels joining at the peak. The raw edges 42 of the seams 76 are trimmed, opened and pressed flat. The brim formed as described hereinabove is sewn to the bottom 12B of the peaked crown 22 and edge finished with fabric tape. The hat is blocked into the desired shape. Optional trim constructed from the lamination topstitched with the stitching pattern is added after blocking.
In conclusion, herein is presented a a crushable, lightweight high-fashion hat made from a plurality of lightweight, breathable and blockable materials that is constructed by a method of cutting and layering the materials and top stitching the layers in a manner that maintains the shape of the hat and helps restore the shape after crushing. The invention is illustrated by example in the drawing figures, and throughout the written description. It should be understood that numerous variations are possible, while adhering to the inventive concept. Such variations are contemplated as being a part of the present invention."
