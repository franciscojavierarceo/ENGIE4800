I've published the preliminary results of my first topic mdoel on the first 10,000 records of 2014. This took ~15 hours to run and used 200 topics (set arbitrarily). There are two files uploaded in this directory ```Top100TopicsFirstTopicModel.csv``` and ```Top100TopicsFirstTopicModel2.csv```, which both contain the top 100 words for each topic. I did not upload the probability of the word belonging to each topic because this file is too large, but I have it. This was run in R for simplicity, the next step is to run this on more data. - FJA
